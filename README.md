## Personal Website
This is a personal website, where I hold simulations, programs, notes, and more. On my home page is basic info and contact info. My simulations page has around 14 different simulations, all of which model things with differential equations. My current favorite simulations is my [3D Phase Space Simulation](https://nasser-mohammed.github.io/simulations/programs/3D%20Phase%20Space/index.html), which you can also learn more about on its [github page](https://github.com/Nasser-Mohammed/3D-Phase-Space). On the math art page you will find several videos and images that are all derived from my simulations, and are visually appealing (to me). My CV page is straightforward. My notes page is where I post notes on various math (and potentially other) topics. These are supposed to be informative and helpful to the reader. However, the process of rewriting the notes and hosting them here has also helped my understanding of the topics. Finally, the pets page is just a page dedicated to the inspirations (family and friend's pets) of the animated images I use on my website and in my simulations.
