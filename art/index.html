    <p>Below are some cool snapshots I captured from adjusting the parameters
      of my own simulations. Dynamical systems can have some very pretty geometric manifestations, due 
      to the uniqueness of solutions of ODEs. This typically causes these infinitely
      long parametric curves to draw out some very interesting shapes in a 
      finite space (this is how we also get fractals). If you would like to generate similar figures,
      you can go to my simulations page <a href="../simulations/programs/Butterfly Effect/index.html", target="_blank">here</a>,
      and click the red button that says "Click to launch", and vary the \(\sigma\), \(\rho\), and \(\beta\)
      values above it to get different behaviors. You can click pause when you find an interesting curve and screenshot.
