    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am currently a master's student in mathematics with a research assistantship from the department of civil engineering at Louisiana State University. Previously, I obtained
        undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science at LSU as well. I plan on completing a PhD in applied mathematics.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My general interests lie in ordinary and partial differential equations, optimization, and numerical analysis.
       My specific research interests are in nonlinear dynamics, optimal control, numerical solutions to PDEs, as well as their applications in engineering, biology, and physics. For example, the autonomous control of robots, aircrafts, and medical devices
       would be considered applications of control theory. Currently, I am conducting research in the 
       department of civil engineering in autonomous print quality quantification and self correcting print processes. This research is largely focused on applying computer vision and control theory to minimize
       deformations and loss of material quality created during the process of underwater 3D concrete printing. This research is being done in Dr. Yen-Fang Su's lab: <a href="https://faculty.lsu.edu/yfslab/about.php" target="_blank">INFRAMAT-X Lab</a> at LSU.
