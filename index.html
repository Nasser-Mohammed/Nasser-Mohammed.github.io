    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a current master's student in the mathematics department at Louisiana State University. Previously, I obtained an
        undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at LSU as well. I plan on completing a PhD in the area of nonlinear dynamics and control theory.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My general interests lie in ordinary and partial differential equations, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
       My specific research interests are in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, as well as their applications in engineering, biology, and physics.
