    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am currently a master's student in mathematics with a research assistantship from the department of civil engineering at Louisiana State University. Previously, I obtained an
        undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at LSU as well. I plan on completing a PhD in the area of nonlinear dynamics and control theory.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My general interests lie in ordinary and partial differential equations, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
       My specific research interests are in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, as well as their applications in engineering, biology, and physics. For example, the autonomous control of robots, aircrafts, and medical devices
       would be considered applications of control theory. Currently, I am conducting research with the 
       department of civil engineering in autonomous print quality quantification and self correcting print processes. This research is largely focused on applying computer vision and control theory to minimize
       deformations and loss of material quality created during the process of underwater 3D concrete printing. This research is being done in Dr. Yen-Fang Su's lab: <a href="https://faculty.lsu.edu/yfslab/about.php" target="_blank">INFRAMAT-X Lab</a> at LSU.
