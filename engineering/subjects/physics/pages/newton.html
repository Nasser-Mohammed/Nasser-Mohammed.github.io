  <main>
<p>
    Newtonian (classical) mechanics is primarily concerned with forces, motion, 
    and the causes of changes in motion. In many contexts—especially macroscopic 
    ones on Earth—it is extremely powerful, in part due to its simplicity. 
    Within this framework, the typical goal is either to find the function that 
    satisfies the second-order differential equation given by Newton’s second law, 
    or to determine the forces required to produce a desired motion. 
    To begin, I will describe Newton’s three laws, which serve as the axioms of 
    Newtonian mechanics.
</p>




    <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
    <p>Also known as the <b>Law of Inertia</b>, this law simply states that 
    an object moving at a constant velocity, will remain at the velocity until
      acted upon by a force.</p>


    <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
    <p>
        This law provides the fundamental differential equation of motion. 
        It states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product 
        of its mass and acceleration:
        \[F = m a\]
        In other words, force causes acceleration, and the magnitude of that 
        acceleration depends on the object's mass.
    </p>

  <h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>
  <p>
      Also known as the law of action and reaction, this law states that for 
      every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, 
      forces always occur in pairs: if one object exerts a force on another, 
      the second exerts an equal and opposite force in return. For example, 
      if you push on a wall, the wall pushes back on you with the same magnitude 
      of force.
  </p>

  <h2>What Next?</h2>
  <p>Now that we've set the rules of our playground, we can determine how things move, 
    act on other things, etc. 

    But first I would like to reinterpret Newton's second law as a differential equation.
    \[F=ma\]
    As mentioned, the goal is to typically find where an object will be in the future, 
    or maybe the function describing where it will be at any time \(t\); you could even 
    be given the way the object moves and then be asked to find the forces that cause that.
    In any case, we are concerned with a function 
    \[x(t)\]
    That gives the position of the object at time \(t\). We know that 
    the derivative of position is velocity. That is, velocity is how fast our position 
    is changing. The rate at which our velocity changes (i.e. the derivative of velocity)
    is acceleration. Therefore, if we are given that 
    \[F=ma\]
    We could equivalently write this as 
    \[F=m\ddot{x}(t)\]
    Where the two dots above the variable \(x\) represent the second time 
    derivative. This represents a second order ODE in time. We can then 
    import methods of solving second order ODEs to this setting. Since 
    \(\sin, \cos\) are eigenfunctions of the second order derivative operator, 
    we expect to see them often. 
  </p>

  <p>That is pretty much all that is concerned with Newtonian Mechanics 
    in terms of its principal axioms. However, there are
    nontrivial considerations for extra things like torque, angular velocity, etc. 
    However, they can all be linked back to these principals, with just 
    specific equations for force. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Also note that we have assumed mass to be constant, which is true for most 
    everyday scenarios. However, in cases like rocket propulsion—where the 
    mass decreases over time as fuel is burned—we must use Newton’s full 
    second law:
    \[ F = \frac{dp}{dt} \]
    This expression reduces to the familiar \( F = ma \) form when mass is constant. 
    In the equation above, \( p \) represents the momentum:
    \[ p = m v, \]
    where \( v \) is the velocity (i.e., \( \dot{x} \)).  
    If the mass changes with time (that is, if \( m = m(t) \)), then applying the chain rule gives:
    \[ \frac{d}{dt}(m v) = \dot{m} v + m \dot{v}, \]
    which can be written as:
    \[ F = \dot{m} \dot{x} + m \ddot{x}. \]
    This more general form is used in problems such as rocket motion and other 
    variable-mass systems. For our purposes, however, we will assume the mass 
    remains constant.
</p>


  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I will go over 5 problems that cover the various different situations 
    you may encounter in Newtonian mechanics. These should be representative 
    of the problems covered in a first year course.
  </p>
<h3>1. Free Fall / Constant Acceleration</h3>
<p>
    A ball of mass \(m\) at rest (zero velocity) is dropped from a height \(h_0\) above the ground.
    The force due to gravity is a constant: \(-mg\) (this is because 
    the acceleration due to gravity is simply \(-g\) so the force must account for 
    mass). Find the height and velocity of the 
    ball as a function of time. 
</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>So we know the force acting on our ball. Which is \(-mg\), then we know that 
  \[-mg = m\ddot{x}(t)\]
  We then see that 
  \[\ddot{x}(t) = -g\]
</p>

<p>Here \(x(t)\) represents the height of the ball at time \(t\). 
  The goal is to then find this function. Qualitatively, \(g\) is constant, 
  therefore velocity is linear in time. In other words, we can directly integrate 
  this twice.
  \[\int \ddot{x}(t) dt = \int -g\ dt = -g \int dt = -gt + C\]
  We know due to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that 
  \[\int\ddot{x}(t) = \dot{x}(t)\]
  Therefore, we have the velocity as a function of time,
  \[\dot{x}(t) = -gt + C\]
  To make things clearer, we just let \(v(t) = \dot{x}(t)\), so
  \[v(t) = -gt + C\]
  At time \(t=0\), we said that the ball was at rest, i.e. \(v(0) = 0\). Therefore, 
  \[v(0) = -g\cdot 0 + C = 0 \implies C = 0\]
  Now we have our final equation of velocity,
    \[v(t) = -gt\]
  Integrating this function, we find the height of the ball as a function of time.
  We can use the velocity equation with or without the constant, since the conditions will 
  give us the same result. However, I will replace \(C\) with \(v_0\) where 
  that represents our initial velocity, since we showed above that they this constant will 
  equal the initial velocity.
  \[\int \dot{x}(t) \ dt = \int -gt + v_0 \ dt\]
  \[\implies x(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0 t + C\]
  Note that \(C\) is a constant and not related to the \(C\) used earlier. 
  Finally, using our initial condition that the height of the ball at time \(t=0\)
  is \(h_0\), we have
    \[ x(0) = -\frac{1}{2}g\cdot(0)^2 + v_0 \cdot 0 + C = h_0\]
    So we see that \(C=h_0\). Therefore, our final equation of motion is 
    \[x(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + h_0\]
    In our case \(v_0 = 0\), so this reduces to
    \[x(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + h_0\]
</p>

<p>Another question might be to determine how long this equation is physically valid for.
  For instance, if we let \(t\to \infty\) eventually, the value will become negative indicating the ball is below 
  the ground, not physically viable. This is 
  straight forward, we would just want to find when \(x(t) \geq 0\). 
  \[-\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + h_0 \geq 0 \implies h_0 \geq \frac{1}{2}gt^2\]
  \[\implies 2h_0 \geq gt^2 \implies t \leq \sqrt{\frac{2h_0}{g}}\]
  So this equation is valid for \(0 \leq t \leq \sqrt{\frac{2h_0}{g}}\)
</p>
<p>Another question might be to find the time at which the ball hits the ground 
  (or reaches any arbitrary point for that matter). This is also straightforward, 
  just set the equation for height equal to \(0\) (or whichever point we want to solve for) and solve for \(t\).
  
  \[x(t) = 0 \implies -\frac{1}{2}gt^2+h_0 = 0\]
  \[\implies gt^2 = 2h_0 \implies t = \sqrt{\frac{2h_0}{g}}\]
  We could have also deduced this from solving for the valid times. 
</p>

<h3>2. Inclined Plane with Friction</h3>
<p>
    A block of mass \(m\) slides down a plane inclined at angle \(\theta\) 
    with coefficient of kinetic friction \(\mu_k\). The net force along the 
    incline is
    \[ F_{\text{net}} = m g \sin\theta - \mu_k m g \cos\theta, \]
    giving the acceleration
    \[ a = g (\sin\theta - \mu_k \cos\theta). \]
    You can solve for the velocity as a function of time or the distance 
    traveled along the incline.
</p>

<h3>3. Mass–Spring System (Simple Harmonic Motion)</h3>
<p>
    A mass \(m\) is attached to a spring with spring constant \(k\). 
    The restoring force is
    \[ F = - k x, \]
    leading to the differential equation
    \[ m \ddot{x} + k x = 0 \quad \implies \quad \ddot{x} + \frac{k}{m} x = 0. \]
    The general solution is
    \[ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t), \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \]
    where \(A\) and \(B\) depend on initial conditions. This models simple 
    oscillatory motion, and can be visualized with an animation of the spring.
</p>

<h3>4. Atwood Machine</h3>
<p>
    Two masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are connected by a light string over a 
    frictionless pulley. Using Newton's second law for each mass:
    \[
        m_1 a = m_1 g - T, \quad m_2 a = T - m_2 g,
    \]
    where \(T\) is the tension and \(a\) is the acceleration. Solving these 
    simultaneously gives
    \[ a = \frac{(m_1 - m_2) g}{m_1 + m_2}, \quad T = \frac{2 m_1 m_2 g}{m_1 + m_2}. \]
    This demonstrates forces in systems of connected bodies.
</p>

<h3>5. Rocket Motion (Variable Mass)</h3>
<p>
    A rocket of initial mass \(m_0\) ejects fuel at a constant velocity \(u\) 
    relative to the rocket. Using the full form of Newton's second law:
    \[ F = \frac{d}{dt}(m v), \]
    and assuming no external forces, the velocity of the rocket as a function of 
    its decreasing mass is
    \[ v = u \ln \frac{m_0}{m}. \]
    This illustrates variable-mass systems and the importance of momentum 
    conservation beyond the \( F = ma \) approximation.
