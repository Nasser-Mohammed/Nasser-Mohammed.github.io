  <main>
  <p>
    Thermodynamics describes the macroscopic behavior of physical systems in terms of quantities
    such as energy, temperature, entropy, and pressure. Its laws are empirical and surprisingly
    universal, applying across a wide range of physical systems without reference to microscopic
    details. Statistical mechanics provides the theoretical framework that connects these
    macroscopic laws to the underlying dynamics of many-particle systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the microscopic level, a system is described by a large number of degrees of freedom evolving
    according to classical or quantum mechanics. Rather than tracking individual trajectories,
    statistical mechanics characterizes the system through probability distributions on phase
    space, allowing macroscopic observables to be defined as ensemble averages.
  </p>

  <h2>Microstates, Macrostates, and Ensembles</h2>

  <p>
    A <em>microstate</em> specifies the complete microscopic configuration of a system, while a
    <em>macrostate</em> is defined by a small number of macroscopic variables such as total energy,
    volume, and particle number. Many distinct microstates may correspond to the same macrostate.
  </p>

  <p>
    To relate microscopic dynamics to macroscopic behavior, statistical mechanics introduces
    ensembles, which are probability distributions over microstates consistent with specified
    macroscopic constraints. Common examples include the microcanonical, canonical, and grand
    canonical ensembles.
  </p>

  <h2>Entropy and the Second Law</h2>

  <p>
    In statistical mechanics, entropy is interpreted as a measure of the number of microscopic
    configurations compatible with a given macrostate. For a discrete set of microstates with
    probabilities \(p_i\), the entropy is given by
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    S = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    This statistical definition provides a microscopic explanation for the second law of
    thermodynamics: macroscopic systems evolve toward states with higher entropy because such states
    correspond to overwhelmingly many microscopic configurations.
  </p>

  <h2>Thermodynamics as a Macroscopic Theory</h2>

  <p>
    Thermodynamics emerges as a closed, macroscopic description in which detailed microscopic
    information is no longer required. Its laws impose constraints on energy exchange, work, heat,
    and entropy production, and they place fundamental limits on efficiency and achievable
    performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    From an engineering perspective, thermodynamics functions as a constraint theory rather than a
    dynamical one. It determines what processes are possible, what losses are unavoidable, and what
    performance limits cannot be exceeded, regardless of the specific mechanisms involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics provide a bridge between microscopic dynamics
    and macroscopic behavior, linking Hamiltonian evolution at the particle level to emergent laws
    governing energy, irreversibility, and equilibrium.
