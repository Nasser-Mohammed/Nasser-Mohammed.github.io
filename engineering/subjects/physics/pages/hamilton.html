  <main>
  <p>
    While Lagrangian mechanics formulates dynamics in terms of generalized coordinates and their
    velocities, Hamiltonian mechanics reformulates the same dynamics in terms of coordinates and
    their conjugate momenta. This leads to a first-order system of equations that naturally
    emphasizes phase space structure, conservation laws, and time evolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    The central object in this formulation is the <strong>Hamiltonian</strong>, defined as the
    Legendre transform of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocities.
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    H(q,p,t) = \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i - L(q,\dot{q},t),
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    where the generalized momenta are given by
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    For many mechanical systems, the Hamiltonian coincides with the total energy of the system,
    though this identification is not fundamental to the formalism.
  </p>

  <h2>Hamilton’s Equations</h2>

  <p>
    The equations of motion in Hamiltonian mechanics are given by Hamilton’s equations,
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i},
    \qquad
    \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    These equations define a first-order dynamical system on phase space. In contrast to
    Newtonian or Lagrangian formulations, position and momentum are treated as independent
    variables whose coupled evolution fully determines the motion.
  </p>

  <h2>Phase Space and Structure</h2>

  <p>
    Hamiltonian dynamics naturally lives on phase space, where trajectories represent the
    evolution of the full state of the system. The flow generated by Hamilton’s equations
    preserves phase space volume and exhibits a rich geometric structure that underlies
    stability, reversibility, and long-term behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    This structure makes Hamiltonian mechanics particularly well suited for studying conservative
    systems, integrability, perturbations, and long-time numerical behavior. It also provides the
    natural foundation for symplectic integration methods and modern formulations of control and
    optimization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian framework extends directly to statistical
    mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory, and plays a central role in modern dynamical
    systems theory.
