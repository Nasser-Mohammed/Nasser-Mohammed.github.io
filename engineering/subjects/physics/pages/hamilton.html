        While Lagrangian mechanics formulates dynamics in terms of generalized coordinates and their
        velocities, Hamiltonian mechanics reformulates the same dynamics in terms of coordinates and
        their conjugate momenta. This leads to a first-order system of equations that naturally
        emphasizes phase space structure, conservation laws, and time evolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        The central object in this formulation is the <strong>Hamiltonian</strong>, defined as the
        Legendre transform of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocities.
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        H(q,p,t) = \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i - L(q,\dot{q},t),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where the generalized momenta are given by
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}.
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        For many mechanical systems, the Hamiltonian coincides with the total energy of the system,
        though this identification is not fundamental to the formalism.
      </p>

      <h2>Hamilton’s Equations</h2>

      <p>
        The equations of motion in Hamiltonian mechanics are given by Hamilton’s equations,
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i},
        \qquad
        \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}.
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        These equations define a first-order dynamical system on phase space. In contrast to
        Newtonian or Lagrangian formulations, position and momentum are treated as independent
        variables whose coupled evolution fully determines the motion.
      </p>

      <h2>Phase Space and Structure</h2>
      
      <p>
        Hamiltonian dynamics naturally lives on phase space, where trajectories represent the
        evolution of the full state of the system. The flow generated by Hamilton’s equations
        preserves phase space volume and exhibits a rich geometric structure that underlies
        stability, reversibility, and long-term behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structure makes Hamiltonian mechanics particularly well suited for studying conservative
        systems, integrability, perturbations, and long-time numerical behavior. It also provides the
        natural foundation for symplectic integration methods and modern formulations of control and
        optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian framework extends directly to statistical
        mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory, and plays a central role in modern dynamical
        systems theory.
