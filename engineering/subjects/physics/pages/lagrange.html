        Classical mechanics is often introduced through Newton’s laws, which describe motion in terms
        of forces acting on particles. While this formulation is intuitive, it can become cumbersome
        for systems with constraints, generalized coordinates, or many interacting degrees of freedom.
        Lagrangian mechanics provides an alternative, coordinate-invariant framework that encodes the
        dynamics of a system through energy rather than force.
      </p>

      <p>
        The central object in Lagrangian mechanics is the <strong>Lagrangian</strong>, defined as
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        L(q, \dot{q}, t) = T(q, \dot{q}) - V(q),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where \(q\) denotes a set of generalized coordinates, \(\dot{q}\) their time derivatives,
        \(T\) the kinetic energy, and \(V\) the potential energy. The dynamics of the system are obtained
        by requiring that the action functional
      </p>

      

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        S[q] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t)\,dt
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        be stationary with respect to variations of the path \(q(t)\).
      </p>

      <h2>Euler–Lagrange Equations</h2>

      <p>
        Applying the principle of stationary action leads to the Euler–Lagrange equations,
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right)
        -
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}
        = 0,
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        which govern the evolution of each generalized coordinate \(q_i\). These equations are
        equivalent to Newton’s second law for conservative systems, but they naturally incorporate
        constraints and allow for arbitrary coordinate choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Advantages of the Lagrangian Formulation</h2>

      <p>
        Lagrangian mechanics shifts the focus from forces to energy and geometry. Constraints can be
        handled implicitly through coordinate selection, symmetries become transparent, and conserved
        quantities arise naturally through invariance principles. This formulation is particularly
        powerful for systems with complex kinematics, coupled degrees of freedom, or underlying
        symmetries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond classical mechanics, the Lagrangian framework extends directly to fields, continuum
        systems, electrodynamics, and modern theoretical physics. It also provides the natural bridge
        to Hamiltonian mechanics, control formulations, and variational methods in applied mathematics.
