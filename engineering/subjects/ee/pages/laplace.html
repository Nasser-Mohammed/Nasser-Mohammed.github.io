      <h1>Laplace Transforms in Circuit Analysis</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">From Differential Equations to Algebraic Frequency Models</p>

    <section class="bio-text">
      <p>
        Once an electrical circuit has been written as a system of ordinary differential equations,
        various analytical tools may be used to study its behavior. One of the most common and useful
        tools is the <strong>Laplace transform</strong>, which converts time-domain differential equations
        into algebraic equations in a complex frequency variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Laplace transform does not change the physics of a circuit. Instead, it provides an
        alternative representation that simplifies analysis, especially for linear systems with
        initial conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>The Laplace Transform</h2>
      <p>
        Given a time-domain function \(f(t)\) defined for \(t \ge 0\), its Laplace transform is defined as
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t)\,e^{-st}\,dt,
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where \(s\) is a complex variable. The transform maps functions of time into functions of
        complex frequency.
      </p>

      <h2>Derivatives and Initial Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        The key reason the Laplace transform is useful for circuit analysis is that it converts time
        derivatives into algebraic expressions. In particular,
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{df}{dt}\right\}
        =
        sF(s) - f(0).
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        Higher-order derivatives introduce higher powers of \(s\) along with additional initial
        condition terms. In this way, the Laplace transform naturally incorporates initial conditions
        into the algebraic structure of the problem.
      </p>

      <h2>Circuits in the Laplace Domain</h2>
      
      <p>
        Applying the Laplace transform to a circuit’s governing differential equations converts them
        into algebraic equations in \(s\). For linear circuits, this allows circuit elements to be
        represented by algebraic relations known as <em>impedances</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Laplace domain, the fundamental circuit elements take the form
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        Z_R = R, \qquad
        Z_C = \frac{1}{sC}, \qquad
        Z_L = sL.
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        Kirchhoff’s laws continue to hold in the Laplace domain, but differential equations are replaced
        by algebraic equations involving these impedances.
      </p>

      <h2>Poles and System Behavior</h2>
      
      <p>
        Solving a circuit in the Laplace domain typically produces rational functions of the form
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        F(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}.
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        The roots of the denominator \(D(s)\), called <strong>poles</strong>, encode the fundamental
        dynamical behavior of the circuit. Their locations determine stability, decay rates, and
        oscillatory behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Real negative poles correspond to exponential decay.</li>
        <li>Complex conjugate poles correspond to damped oscillations.</li>
        <li>Poles with positive real part indicate instability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Relation to Time-Domain Dynamics</h2>
      <p>
        Although the Laplace transform simplifies analysis, it does not replace time-domain reasoning.
        The poles of a Laplace-domain solution correspond directly to the eigenvalues of the underlying
        dynamical system.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this perspective, the Laplace transform provides a compact way to study the same dynamics
        already present in the circuit’s state-space formulation. It is best viewed as a tool for
        solving and interpreting linear dynamical systems rather than a separate physical theory.
