      <p class="subtitle">From Maxwell's Equations to Potential Difference</p>
      <hr class="subtle-hr">
    </header>

    <section class="bio-text">
      <p>
          Now that we properly understand Maxwell's equations, we can begin to exploit them for 
          certain tasks. The most obvious and direct application of Maxwell's equations can be found in 
          the field of circuits. A circuit is typically a closed loop of conductive wire that is connected
          at two points to something that can maintain an electric potential difference between the two points.
          The device I described that maintains this potential difference is typically a battery or some other power source. The electric 
          potential difference is also known as <strong>voltage</strong>.
      </p>

      

      <p>
          If we recall, the electric field \(\textbf{E}\) gives us the force per unit charge at some point. However, this is a vector field.
          Instead we might want to know what the energy per unit charge is at some point. This is precisely 
          the concept of the <strong>electric potential</strong>. However, this introduces a new concept of 
          energy, which then raises the question: <strong>what is energy?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
          In this context, energy refers to <strong>the ability to do work</strong>.
          Again, we have introduced another foreign concept. This raises the next natural question: 
          <strong>what is work?</strong>
          Work is simply the force applied over a displacement. In a mathematical formulation, it can be 
          represented as
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}
      \]
      </div>
      <p>
      Why have we introduced these concepts? Well, anytime we have a force field (electric, gravitational, etc.), 
      the motion of an object under the influence of that field involves, by definition, the work done by the field.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the electric field example, we can find the force on a charge \(q\) through the relation
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          \vec{F} = q\vec{E}
      \]</div>
      <p>
          Therefore, the work done by the field to move a charge along a displacement \(d\mathbf{\ell}\) is
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          dW = \vec{F} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = q \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
      \]</div>
      <p>
          Think of this work as energy transferred to the particle. Energy is like money in your bank account, 
          and work is like spending or transferring that money. We can connect work to the electric potential 
          difference between two points in space:
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          W = q \Delta V
      \]</div>
      <p>
          For a small displacement in a uniform field, we can substitute and divide by \(q\):
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = -\Delta V
      \]</div>
      <p>
          More generally, for non-uniform fields or curved paths, the potential difference is given by an integral:
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
      \]</div>
      <p>
          This shows that the electric field determines how much work is done per unit charge. In other words, it sets the voltage between points in a circuit.
          Sometimes it is helpful to consider a gravitational example. Imagine we have a hill, and we are determining 
          the effect of gravity on an object. 
          The electric field would be like the slope of the hill at each point, whereas the electric potential would 
          be like the height of the hill at each point. 
      </p>

      

      <p>Again, imagine our electric field. We can also think of the potential at a certain point as follows. 
          Start at the origin, and walk to the point you want to determine the potential of. Each step you 
          add up the vector of the field, and once you get to the point you will have the value of the 
          potential at that point. This idea of 
          adding up vector contributions is simply an integral and therefore
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
      V(\textbf{r}) = -\int_{\text{reference}}^{\textbf{r}} \vec{E}\cdot d\ell
      \]</div>
      <p>
          Since \(\Delta V = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}}\), we can write:
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          \Delta V = V(\textbf{r}_2) - V(\textbf{r}_1)
      \]</div>
      <p>
          This gives the potential difference between two points, which can also be expressed as:
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">\[
          \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
      \]</div>
      <p>
          In static electric fields, this integral is path-independent. Since the field is conservative, 
          the potential difference depends only on the start and end points, not the path taken. However, 
          in more complicated scenarios like time-varying electric fields, the potential difference can depend 
          on the path. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Fortunately, in the majority of small-scale circuits, such as those on a breadboard, we can 
          safely use the concept of potential difference between two points. Even if there are slightly 
          changing electric or magnetic fields, the resulting electromagnetic waves have wavelengths much 
          larger than the circuit, so their effect is negligible.
      </p>
      <p>
          To connect this to circuits: the potential difference across a component “drives” current. 
          The electric field in the wire exerts a force on charges, transferring energy from the source 
          (like a battery) to the device. Think of potential as the “height of a hill” and the electric field 
          as the slope, the charges “roll down” from high to low potential, converting energy into motion or 
          heat.
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, if a 9V battery is connected across a resistor, each coulomb of charge loses 9J of
           potential energy as it moves through the resistor, that energy is dissipated as heat. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Finally, note that in AC or high-frequency circuits, this simple ΔV picture is an approximation. 
          At very high frequencies, the full set of Maxwell's equations governs how electric and magnetic 
          fields interact, and voltage becomes a more subtle concept.
      </p>

      <h2>Batteries</h2>
      
      <p>It's important to have at least a rough understanding of how batteries work. 
          I currently have a limited understanding of chemistry so I will not be able to go into 
          much detail. This discussion will be primarily about the <strong>alkaline battery</strong>.
          Now, we start with the idea of an <strong>anode</strong> and <strong>cathode</strong>.
          These are two different types of <strong>electrodes</strong>. An electrode is a 
          conductor that lets current enter or leave a material (battery for example).
          The anode is what releases the electrons into the circuit, and is the 
          negative (-) side of a battery. The cathode receives electrons from the circuit, 
          and is the positive (+) side of a battery. An ion is a charged particle (nonzero charge). A cation is a 
          positively charged ion, and an anion is a negatively charged ion. In an alkaline battery,
          manganese dioxide is used in the cathode, and zinc is used in the anode. Between the 
          two electrodes is an electrolytic fluid (an electrolyte). The electrodes are 
          overall pretty much electrically neutral despite the (+) and (-) distinction. 
          The (+) and (-) distinction is more related to whether it consumes or supplies electrons. 
          Where producing is (-) and consuming is (+). However, as mentioned the zinc in the anode is 
          electrically neutral (30 protons and 30 electrons). Similarly, manganese oxide has 
          41 protons and electrons (and therefore electrically neutral). Before connecting 
          the battery to a circuit, there is a tiny imbalance of charge. The anode has a 
          slight excess of electrons (therefore slightly negative), and the cathode has a 
          slight lack of electrons (therefore slightly positive). This slight imbalance 
          is tiny and as mentioned the actual anode and cathode are considered relatively 
          neutral, however, it is what establishes the electric field and is the catalyst for current flow.
          It's really just that their atomic structure has the <em>tendency</em> 
          to lose electrons in the anode, and gain electrons in the cathode. This tendency 
          is called <strong>chemical potential</strong> (or redox potential).
      </p>

      <p>Now let's discuss the electrolytic fluid in between the anode and cathode. 
          This is a fluid that contains <strong>free ions</strong> (i.e. cations and anions).
          Unlike the ions that make up metals and are bound to the rigid lattice, the 
          ions in the electrolytic fluid can move freely.
          The electrolytic fluid's main role is to keep the battery overall electrically 
          neutral and to disolve the anode as "fuel". It's essentially the battery's balancing system. Before the 
          circuit has been closed, the fluid will already be arranged to maintain 
          electric charge neutrality.
          Now, the chemical potential mentioned earlier makes the corresponding electrode 
          "want" to gain or lose an electron to reach a lower energy state. In the anode, the atoms want to 
          lose an electron (oxidation). In the cathode, the atoms want to gain an electron 
          (reduction).
          For example, in the alkaline battery with a zinc anode, oxidation occurs. Zinc 
          atoms lose electrons, which then go into the wire of the circuit. More specifically, 
          zinc undergoes the reaction,</p>
          <div class="math-display">\[
              \text{Zn(s)} \to \text{Zn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 2e^-\]
          </div>
      
          <p>What this says, is that the zinc will lose two electrons, 
              which will flow into the wire, whereas the \(Zn^{2+}\) now positively charged zinc
              ion will flow into the electrolyte. In other words, the electrolyte dissolves the zinc 
              metal to power the circuit. 
              At the other end, 
              the cathode made of manganese dioxide undergoes reduction reactions, where electrons 
              leaving the wire are "consumed". The formula for this reaction is, </p>
          <div class="math-display">\[
              2\text{MnO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^- \to \text{Mn}_2\text{O}_3 + 2\text{OH}^-\]
          </div>
          <p>This reaction consumes two electrons for each reaction. Instead of dissolving the 
              cathode, it accumulates its products. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
              This process is obviously finite and limited by 
              how many atoms you have that can undergo this reaction. Once there are no atoms that can react, 
              the battery is dead. So the battery life can 
              be thought of as the stored up chemical potential of all the atoms that make up the 
              positive and negative side. The ions in the electrolyte arrange themselves
              to still be neutral with respect to the other ions inside the fluid and to account for 
              the new ions entering the fluid. 
           </p>

      <p>Now we need to revisit the slight charge imbalance we mentioned earlier. We have described how the 
          process is fueld once it starts (i.e. by dissolving the zinc anode). But what starts this process? 
          What's the difference between a battery not connected to a circuit and one that is? It turns out that 
          the charge imbalance mentioned earlier is the initial driving factor of current. When the battery is just 
          sitting unconnected, there will be some reactions between the electrolyte and the anode. 
          This releases the aforementioned zinc ion and 2 electrons. After a small scale of these reactions,
          the newly charged particles tip the electric neutrality to be slightly negatively charged.
          This new charge density at the surface of the electrode establishes an electric field. 
          However, this will cause the reactions at the surface of the electrolyte and electrode to stop,
          as the electric field established by negative charge will oppose further electron release. 
          The point at which the tendency for the electrode to react with the electrolyte is 
          exactly countered by the opposing electric field from the surface charge in a disconnected battery 
          is called the <strong>open-circuit voltage</strong>. It's also the <strong>electrochemical equilibrium</strong>.
          The zinc reaction is <strong>thermodynamically favorable</strong>, because zinc metal is less stable in 
          the presence of the electrolyte than zinc ions are. There is more electrochemistry to consider, but I am not 
          knowledgable enough on the topic. 

          Once we connect the circuit, the built up charge can now be influenced by the electric field. You might 
          question this as the surface charges are themsevles the electric field, so how would they move themselves?
          Well the electric field isn't established by one charge but rather a charge density near the surface. 
          Electrons close to the wire will experience the most electric force, essentially peeling them off. While 
          this happens more reactions are free to take place, replenshing the lost electrons.
          </p>
      <p>
          One observation is that the amount of surface charge that can build is essentially 
          the strength of the electric field and therefore the strength of the battery. 

      </p>

      <p>One question that I had, was how can the battery be electrically neutral, but have 
          an electric field? Now this might not be a great question but it still made me think. 
          The reason we have an electric field with an overall electrically neutral battery, is because the 
          charge density is what creates electric fields, not total charge. So we have 
          charge density at both ends of the battery, due to very small surface charges between the 
          electrolyte and electrode. 
      </p>

      <h2>Electricity and the Flow of Electrons</h2>

      <p>So what exactly is electricity? What happens in a wire connected to a battery? 
          The answer is surprisingly tricky. Electricity is essentially the flow of electrons in a wire, 
          but why do they flow? The main reason is the electric field. A battery maintains a surface charge 
          distribution between the anode and electrolytic fluid, which 
          sets up an electric field that can push electrons through a circuit. However, this isn't the whole 
          story. Once the circuit is closed, the electric field inside the wire itself also becomes important.
      </p>

      

      <p>Here's the nuance: the electric field along the wire isn't just produced by the battery. 
          Tiny surface charges accumulate along the wire and dynamically adjust to guide electrons along 
          the path of the conductor. These surface charges ensure that the electrons follow the actual 
          geometry of the wire and help maintain a roughly constant current, even if the wire twists or 
          turns. In other words, the wire isn't a passive channel; its own charge distribution is actively 
          shaping the electric field that drives the flow of electrons.
      </p>

      <p>So, while the battery sets the stage by creating a potential difference, the surface charges along 
          the wire play a crucial role in making sure electricity actually flows in the right direction and 
          at a steady rate. This interplay between the battery and the wire's surface charges is what makes 
          the simple idea of “electrons flow because of voltage” more accurate in real-world circuits.
      </p>

      <h2>Energy Dissipation and Heat from Currents</h2>
      <p>Even at room temperature, an electron moves extremely fast, on the order of \(10^6 m/s\). This is known as 
          the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_energy" target="_blank">Fermi velocity</a>. 
          It's roughly \(1/300\) the speed of light. 
          However this thermal motion is random and therefore the electrons stay in roughly the same 
          area. The wire is already at <strong>thermal equilibrium</strong>, and therefore this 
          random motion is exactly that <strong>equilibrium state</strong> of the system. 
          Therefore we don't see any extra energy fluctuations from electrons colliding with the ion lattice 
          (the positively charged atomic cores, consisting of nuclei plus bound electrons).
          However, the electric field of a battery (plus the electric field 
          mentioned above) causes the entire sea of electrons to start 
          drifting through the metal lattice. This drift speed is extremely slow, on the order of
          \(\approx 1-2mm/s\), a few millimeters a second. As they drift, the electrons are 
          continuously colliding with the atomic lattice. However, the electric field is doing 
          work on those electrons, and therefore we are no longer in a thermal equilibrium. 
          The strength of the fields determines the force at which the electrons collide with 
          the lattice. As they collide, energy is transferred from the field, to the electrons, 
          and finally to the lattice (i.e. the metal wire). This kinetic energy that the 
          metal wire receives is precisely heat. Therefore we can deduce that to get a hotter wire, 
          we can increase the force at which the electrons collide with the lattice via a stronger 
          electric field and/or increase the drift speed that they are colliding with the lattice. 
          Both are a result of an increase in the strength of the electric field, i.e. more voltage. 
          This will induce more current, which then dissipates more energy as heat. This concept is also 
          how we have things like stoves, heaters, toasters, etc. Note that increasing the 
          voltage only minimally increases the drift speed, but does increase the force 
          substantially. So the energy we see dissipated is mostly as a result of the force 
          of the electric field, not the speed of the electrons.
