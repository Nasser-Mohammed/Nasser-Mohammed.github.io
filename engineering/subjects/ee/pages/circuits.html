  <main>
    <p>
        Now that we properly understand Maxwell's equations, we can begin to exploit them for 
        certain tasks. The most obvious and direct application of Maxwell's equations can be found in 
        the field of circuits. A circuit is typically a closed loop of conductive wire that is connected
        at two points to something that can maintain an electric potential difference between the two points.
        The device I described that maintains this potential difference is typically a battery or some other power source. The electric 
        potential difference is also known as <strong>voltage</strong>. If we recall, the electric field 
        \(\textbf{E}\) gives us the force per unit charge at some point. However, this is a vector field.
        Instead we might want to know what the energy per unit charge is at some point. This is precisely 
        the concept of the <strong>electric potential</strong>. However, this introduces a new concept of 
        energy, which then raises the question: <strong>what is energy?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this context, energy refers to <strong>the ability to do work</strong>.
        Again, we have introduced another foreign concept. This raises the next natural question: 
        <strong>what is work?</strong>
        Work is simply the force applied over a displacement. In a mathematical formulation, it can be 
        represented as
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
    Why have we introduced these concepts? Well, anytime we have a force field (electric, gravitational, etc.), 
    the motion of an object under the influence of that field involves, by definition, the work done by the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the electric field example, we can find the force on a charge \(q\) through the relation
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \vec{F} = q\vec{E}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Therefore, the work done by the field to move a charge along a displacement \(d\mathbf{\ell}\) is
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        dW = \vec{F} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = q \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Think of this work as energy transferred to the particle. Energy is like money in your bank account, 
        and work is like spending or transferring that money. We can connect work to the electric potential 
        difference between two points in space:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        W = q \Delta V
    \]</div>
    <p>
        For a small displacement in a uniform field, we can substitute and divide by \(q\):
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = -\Delta V
    \]</div>
    <p>
        More generally, for non-uniform fields or curved paths, the potential difference is given by an integral:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        This shows that the electric field determines how much work is done per unit charge. In other words, it sets the voltage between points in a circuit.
        Sometimes it is helpful to consider a gravitational example. Imagine we have a hill, and we are determining 
        the effect of gravity on an object. 
        The electric field would be like the slope of the hill at each point, whereas the electric potential would 
        be like the height of the hill at each point. 
    </p>
    <p>Again, imagine our electric field. We can also think of the potential at a certain point as follows. 
        Start at the origin, and walk to the point you want to determine the potential of. Each step you 
        add up the vector of the field, and once you get to the point you will have the value of the 
        potential at that point. Every step the vector tells you to go up or down a certain amount, 
        so by the time you reach your point, you will be at the height that you wished to find. This idea of 
        adding up vector contributions is simply an integral and therefore
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
    V(\textbf{r}) = -\int_{\text{reference}}^{\textbf{r}} \vec{E}\cdot d\ell
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Since \(\Delta V = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}}\), we can write:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = V(\textbf{r}_2) - V(\textbf{r}_1)
    \]</div>
    <p>
        This gives the potential difference between two points, which can also be expressed as:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        In static electric fields, this integral is path-independent. Since the field is conservative, 
        the potential difference depends only on the start and end points, not the path taken. However, 
        in more complicated scenarios like time-varying electric fields, the potential difference can depend 
        on the path. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, in the majority of small-scale circuits, such as those on a breadboard, we can 
        safely use the concept of potential difference between two points. Even if there are slightly 
        changing electric or magnetic fields, the resulting electromagnetic waves have wavelengths much 
        larger than the circuit, so their effect is negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To connect this to circuits: the potential difference across a component “drives” current. 
        The electric field in the wire exerts a force on charges, transferring energy from the source 
        (like a battery) to the device. Think of potential as the “height of a hill” and the electric field 
        as the slope, the charges “roll down” from high to low potential, converting energy into motion or 
        heat.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if a 9V battery is connected across a resistor, each coulomb of charge loses 9J of
         potential energy as it moves through the resistor, that energy is dissipated as heat. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, note that in AC or high-frequency circuits, this simple ΔV picture is an approximation. 
        At very high frequencies, the full set of Maxwell's equations governs how electric and magnetic 
        fields interact, and voltage becomes a more subtle concept.
    </p>

    <h2>Batteries</h2>
    <p>It's important to have atleast a rough understanding of how batteries work. 
        I currently have a limited understanding of chemistry so I will not be able to go into 
        much detail. Now, we start with the idea of an <strong>anode</strong> and <strong>cathode</strong>.
        These are two different types of <strong>electrodes</strong>. An electrode is a 
        conductor that lets current to enter or leave a material (battery for example).
        The anode is what releases the electrons into the circuit, and is the 
        negative (-) side of a battery. The cathode receives electrons from the circuit, 
        and is the positive (+) side of a battery. The naming convention is due to the type of 
        atom used at either end. An ion is a charged particle (nonzero charge). A cation is a 
        positively charged ion, and an anion is a negatively charged ion. In an alkaline battery,
        manganese dioxide is used in the cathode, and zinc is used in the anode. Between the 
        two electrodes is an electrolytic fluid (an electrolyte). These electrodes are 
        overall pretty much electrically neutral despite the (+) and (-) distinction. Before connecting 
        the battery to a circuit, there is a tiny imbalance of charge. The anode has a 
        slight excess of electrons (therefore slightly negative), and the cathode has a 
        slight lack of electrons (therefore slightly positive). However this slight imbalance 
        is negligible and as mentioned the actual anode and cathode are considered relatively 
        neutral. It's really just that their atomic structure has the <em>tendency</em> 
        to gain electrons in the cathode, and lose electrons in the anode. This tendency 
        is called <strong>chemical potential</strong> (or redox potential).
    </p>
    <p>Now let's discuss the electrolytic fluid in between the anode and cathode. 
        This is a fluid that contains <strong>free ions</strong> (i.e. cations and anions).
        Unlike the ions that make up metals and are bound to the rigid lattice, the 
        ions in the electrolytic fluid can move freely.
        The electrolytic fluid's main role is to keep the battery overall electrically 
        neutral. It's essentially the battery's balancing system. Before the 
        circuit has been closed, the fluid will already be arranged to maintain 
        electric charge neutrality. The cations will be closer 
        to the anode, since the negatively charged anode attracts positive cations. 
        Conversely, the anions will be closer to the cathode, since the positively charged 
        cathode attract negative anions. 
        Now, the chemical potential mentioned earlier makes the corresponding electrode 
        "want" to gain or lose an electron to reach a lower energy state. In the cathode, the atoms want to 
        gain an electron (since they have a lack of electrons), this process is known as
        <strong>oxidation</strong>. In the anode, the atoms want to lose an electron 
        (since they have extra), this process is known as <stong>reduction</stong>.
        For example, in the Alkaline battery with a zinc anode, oxidation occurs. Zinc 
        atoms lose electrons, which then go into the wire of the circuit. At the other end, 
        the cathode made of manganese dioxide atoms undergo reduction reactions, where electrons 
        leaving the wire are "consumed". This process is obviously finite and limited by 
        how many atoms you have to undergo this reaction. Once there are no atoms left to 
        react, every atom is now "stable" and the battery is dead. So the battery life can 
        be thought of as the stored up chemical potential of all the atoms that make up the 
        positive and negative side. During this process of discharging electrons, 
        the ions near each electrode will slowly start drifiting more towards the middle of 
        the fluid since there's no longer anything to be attracted to. They'll arrange themselves
        to still be neutral with respect to the other ions inside the fluid. 
    </p>
    <p>One thing we can tell from this, is that the electric field strength is determined 
        by how many atoms we can put on both ends of the battery. Also, we see that this 
        electric field gets weaker with time. As more electrons leave and enter, there are more 
        neutral atoms and therefore less total charge. 
    </p>
    <p>One question that I had, was how can the battery be electrically neutral, but have 
        an electric field? Now this might not be a great question but it still made me think. 
        The reason we have an electric field with an overall electrically neutral battery, is because the 
        charge density is what creates electric fields, not total charge. So we have 
        charge density at both ends of the battery, even if they are roughly inversely proportional. 
    </p>


    <h2>Electricity and the Flow of Electrons</h2>
    <p>So what exactly is electricity? What happens in a wire connected to a battery? The answer 
        is surprisingly hard to find or deduce to an acceptable degree of accuracy. Electricity is 
        essentially the flow of electrons in a wire. But why do they flow? Answer: the electric field. We know
        that a battery can maintain a voltage which will produce an electric field. However, 
        this answer still needs some nuance. It is not only the electric field produced by 
        the battery, but also the electric field produce from <em>within</em> the wire.
    </p>
    <p>First, let's simply assume that the only electric field doing work is that of 
        the battery. There are two main things we will need to be true. One is that the current 
        should be constant. Two is that the flow of electrons needs to match the actual 
        geometry of the wire.
    </p>

    <h2>Energy Dissipation and Heat from Currents</h2>
    <p>Even at room temperature, an electron moves extremely fast, on the order of \(10^6 m/s\). This is known as 
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_energy" target="_blank">Fermi velocity</a>. 
        It's roughly \(1/300\) the speed of light. 
        However this thermal motion is random and therefore the electrons stay in roughly the same 
        area. The wire is already at <strong>thermal equilibrium</strong>, and therefore this 
        random motion is exactly that <strong>equilibrium state</strong> of the system. 
        Therefore we don't see any extra energy fluctuations from electrons colliding with the ion lattice 
        (the positively charged atomic cores, consisting of nuclei plus bound electrons).
        However, the electric field of a battery (plus the electric field 
        mentioned above) causes the entire sea of electrons to start 
        drifting through the metal lattice. This drift speed is extremely slow, on the order of
        \(\approx 1-2mm/s\), a few millimeters a second. As they drift, the electrons are 
        continuously colliding with the atomic lattice. However, the electric field is doing 
        work on those electrons, and therefore we are no longer in a thermal equilibrium. 
        The strength of the fields determines the force at which the electrons collide with 
        the lattice. As they collide, energy is transferred from the field, to the electrons, 
        and finally to the lattice (i.e. the metal wire). This kinetic energy that the 
        metal wire receives is precisely heat. Therefore we can deduce that to get a hotter wire, 
        we can increase the force at which the electrons collide with the lattice via a stronger 
        electric field and/or increase the drift speed that they are colliding with the lattice. 
        Both are a result of an increase in the strength of the electric field, i.e. more voltage. 
        This will induce more current, which then dissipates more energy as heat. This concept is also 
        how we have things like stoves, heaters, toasters, etc. Note that increasing the 
        voltage only minimally increases the drift speed, but does increase the force 
        substantially. So the energy we see dissipated is mostly as a result of the force 
        of the electric field, not the speed of the electrons.
