  <main>
    <p>Now that we have covered a majority of the concepts found in circuits from a 
        field perspective (using Maxwell's equations), we can now make various simplifications
        to the quantities and ideas found in smaller scale circuits. It would be cumbersome to 
        try to compute the various electric fields and other things all the time so instead we make some 
        realistic assumptions which allows us to get more straightforward deductions of the nature of the 
        circuit. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>As mentioned, the most useful aspect of our assumptions will be simplification of 
        electromagnetic phenomena found in small scale (and typically DC) circuits. 
        With these reductions we can readily compute things like voltage, current, resistance, etc. 
        The first of which is <strong>Ohm's Law</strong>. Ohm's Law gives us a nice relationship between 
        voltage, resistance, and current. It is given by
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
        \[ V = I R \]
    </div>
    <p>Where \(V\) is voltage (measured in volts V), \(I\) is current (measured in amps A), and 
        \(R\) is resistance (measured in Ohm's \(\Omega\))
