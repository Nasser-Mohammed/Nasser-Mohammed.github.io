    <p>
        Now that we properly understand Maxwell's equations, we can begin to exploit them for 
        certain tasks. The most obvious and direct application of Maxwell's equations can be found in 
        the field of circuits. A circuit is typically a closed loop of conductive wire that is connected
        at two points to something that can maintain an electric potential difference between the two points.
        The device I described that maintains this potential difference is typically a battery or some other power source. The electric 
        potential difference is also known as <strong>voltage</strong>. If we recall, the electric field 
        \(\textbf{E}\) gives us the force per unit charge at some point. However, this is a vector field.
        Instead we might want to know what the energy per unit charge is at some point. This is precisely 
        the concept of the <strong>electric potential</strong>. However, this introduces a new concept of 
        energy, which then raises the question: <strong>what is energy?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this context, energy refers to <strong>the ability to do work</strong>.
        Again, we have introduced another foreign concept. This raises the next natural question: 
        <strong>what is work?</strong>
        Work is simply the force applied over a displacement. In a mathematical formulation, it can be 
        represented as
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
    Why have we introduced these concepts? Well, anytime we have a force field (electric, gravitational, etc.), 
    the motion of an object under the influence of that field involves, by definition, the work done by the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the electric field example, we can find the force on a charge \(q\) through the relation
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \vec{F} = q\vec{E}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Therefore, the work done by the field to move a charge along a displacement \(d\mathbf{\ell}\) is
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        dW = \vec{F} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = q \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Think of this work as energy transferred to the particle. Energy is like money in your bank account, 
        and work is like spending or transferring that money. We can connect work to the electric potential 
        difference between two points in space:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        W = q \Delta V
    \]</div>
    <p>
        For a small displacement in a uniform field, we can substitute and divide by \(q\):
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = -\Delta V
    \]</div>
    <p>
        More generally, for non-uniform fields or curved paths, the potential difference is given by an integral:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        This shows that the electric field determines how much work is done per unit charge. In other words, it sets the voltage between points in a circuit.
        Sometimes it is helpful to consider a gravitational example. Imagine we have a hill, and we are determining 
        the effect of gravity on an object. 
        The electric field would be like the slope of the hill at each point, whereas the electric potential would 
        be like the height of the hill at each point. 
    </p>
    <p>Again, imagine our electric field. We can also think of the potential at a certain point as follows. 
        Start at the origin, and walk to the point you want to determine the potential of. Each step you 
        add up the vector of the field, and once you get to the point you will have the value of the 
        potential at that point. Every step the vector tells you to go up or down a certain amount, 
        so by the time you reach your point, you will be at the height that you wished to find. This idea of 
        adding up vector contributions is simply an integral and therefore
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
    V(\textbf{r}) = -\int_{\text{reference}}^{\textbf{r}} \vec{E}\cdot d\ell
    \]</div>
    <p>
        Since \(\Delta V = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}}\), we can write:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = V(\textbf{r}_2) - V(\textbf{r}_1)
    \]</div>
    <p>
        This gives the potential difference between two points, which can also be expressed as:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \Delta V = - \int_{\text{path}} \vec{E} \cdot d\mathbf{\ell}
    \]</div>
    <p>
        In static electric fields, this integral is path-independent. Since the field is conservative, 
        the potential difference depends only on the start and end points, not the path taken. However, 
        in more complicated scenarios like time-varying electric fields, the potential difference can depend 
        on the path. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, in the majority of small-scale circuits, such as those on a breadboard, we can 
        safely use the concept of potential difference between two points. Even if there are slightly 
        changing electric or magnetic fields, the resulting electromagnetic waves have wavelengths much 
        larger than the circuit, so their effect is negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To connect this to circuits: the potential difference across a component “drives” current. 
        The electric field in the wire exerts a force on charges, transferring energy from the source 
        (like a battery) to the device. Think of potential as the “height of a hill” and the electric field 
        as the slope, the charges “roll down” from high to low potential, converting energy into motion or 
        heat.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if a 9V battery is connected across a resistor, each coulomb of charge loses 9J of
         potential energy as it moves through the resistor, that energy is dissipated as heat. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, note that in AC or high-frequency circuits, this simple ΔV picture is an approximation. 
        At very high frequencies, the full set of Maxwell's equations governs how electric and magnetic 
        fields interact, and voltage becomes a more subtle concept.
    </p>


    <h2>Electricity and the Flow of Electrons</h2>
    <p>So what exactly is electricity? What happens in a wire connected to a battery? Electricity is 
        essentially the flow of electrons in a wire. But why do they flow? Answer: the electric field. We know
        that a battery can maintain a voltage which will produce an electric field.
