  <main>
    <p>Now that we have covered a majority of the concepts found in circuits from a 
        field perspective (using Maxwell's equations), we can now make various simplifications
        to the quantities and ideas found in smaller scale circuits. It would be cumbersome to 
        try to compute the various electric fields and other things all the time so instead we make some 
        realistic assumptions which allows us to get more straightforward deductions of the nature of the 
        circuit. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>As mentioned, the most useful aspect of our assumptions will be simplification of 
        electromagnetic phenomena found in small scale (and typically DC) circuits. 
        With these reductions we can readily compute things like voltage, current, resistance, etc. 
        The first of which is <strong>Ohm's Law</strong>. Ohm's Law gives us a nice relationship between 
        voltage, resistance, and current. It is given by
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
        \[ V = I R \]
    </div>
    <p>Where \(V\) is voltage (measured in volts V), \(I\) is current (measured in amps A), and 
        \(R\) is resistance (measured in Ohm's \(\Omega\))
    </p>
    <h2>Kirchhoff's Laws</h2>
    <p>Kirchhoff's laws are not really "laws" in the sense that nature follows them. Instead, 
      they are useful and very accurate approximations for DC circuits and for low frequency AC currents,
      since the wavelengths of electromagnetic waves are much larger than the physical size of the 
      circuits. These can be mathematically deduced from Maxwell's equations and are not just 
      guesses. 
    </p>
    <h3>Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</h3>
    <p>This law is also known as the conservation of charge. It states that the sum of currents at a 
      node \(= 0\). This basically means that the amount of current entering a point must be the same 
      as the amount of current leaving it. 
      A node is basically a point where two or more circuit elements connect together. 
      It can be thought of as a junction of the circuit. More specifically, a node is a set of points 
      that have the same voltage. Typically, we draw the voltage source and then 
      lines representing the conductive wire in a loop back to the voltage source's other end. 
      In between that is where we put all of our circuit elements. This law at a node can be represented as,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      \sum_{j=1}^{n}I_j = 0\]
    </div>
    <p>This represents a node with \(n\) currents that can be exiting or entering the node.
      We can think about it like this, if we have three different currents flowing into a point and 
      only one flowing out, then \(I_1+I_2+I_3 = I_4\), this implies that 
      \(I_1+I_2+I_3 - I_4 = 0\). The sign convention does not relate to the actual sign of the current flow. 
      The current is always a negative flow, since it's the flow of electrons. Although, the actual convention 
      is that current flows in the direction that positive charge would, but this is not relevant to the
      Kirchhoff's Current Law. We can consider the currents entering a point as positive, and those leaving as 
      negative in this law. This convention is unique for each node. By that I mean a current can leave one 
      node (and therefore be considered "negative" in the nodal analysis of the first node) and enter another 
      node (and therefore be considered "positive" in the nodal analysis of the second node). So this convention 
      is local for each node. 
    </p>
    <h3>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</h3>
    <p>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is also known as the conservation of energy (in this context). It states that 
      the sum of voltages around a loop must be \(0\). Mathematically this is expressed as,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \sum_{k=1}^{n}V_k = 0
      \]
    </div>
    <p>Where \(V_k\) is the voltage across the \(k\)-th element of the circuit. 
      A loop is simply any closed path that starts at a node and returns to the same node. 
      These can appear as sub-loops inside the circuit where this law still holds. 
      When we say the "voltage across" an element, we mean the change in electric potential from one side 
      of the element to the other side. Mathematically, this is
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      V = V_{\text{end}} - V_{\text{start}}\]
    </div>
    <p>This is the same concept as voltage, the difference in electric potential between two points.</p>

    <p>As mentioned, these laws are used in the specific context of DC and low frequency AC circuits. 
      Furthmore, these usually assume a steady-state current. This typically isn't a problem; my 
      interpretation is that the current reaches steady-state almost instantaneously and therefore 
      this assumption is of no concern. 
    </p>

    <h2>Deriving Kirchhoff's Laws from Maxwell's Equations</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned, Kirchhoff's Laws can be derived from Maxwell's equations under certain assumptions. 
      This helps explain why they work so well for DC circuits and low-frequency AC circuits.
      The derivations usually come from manipulating Maxwell's equationas and then making assumptions.
    </p>

    <h3>Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</h3>
    <p>
      KCL is based on the <strong>continuity equation</strong>, which comes from the law of charge conservation: 
      \[
        \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
      \]
      Here, <em>\(\mathbf{J}\)</em> is the current density and <em>\(\rho\)</em> is the charge density. 
      In a steady-state DC circuit, the charge density doesn't change over time, so \(\partial \rho / \partial t = 0\). 
      This gives \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0\), meaning the net current into any point (node) is zero, exactly KCL.
    </p>

    <h3>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</h3>
    <p>
      KVL comes from Faraday's law of induction: 
      \[
        \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
      \]
      For DC circuits or circuits with slowly changing currents, the magnetic flux \(\Phi_B\) is approximately constant, so \(\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \approx 0\). 
      This simplifies to \(\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0\), meaning the sum of voltage drops around any closed loop is zero, exactly KVL.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, Kirchhoff's Laws are <strong>approximations valid when electric and magnetic fields are relatively uniform and changing slowly</strong>. 
      This is why they are extremely accurate for small-scale circuits and low-frequency signals.
    </p>


    <h2>Circuit Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      So far we've talked about circuits and nodes, but we haven't shown what they actually look like. 
      Circuits are usually drawn as diagrams with <strong>nodes</strong> (junctions) and <strong>elements</strong> (resistors, batteries, capacitors, etc.) connected by wires. 
      There isn't one “canonical” way to draw a circuit, but a common approach is to start with a node representing the voltage source (for example, a battery), 
      then draw wires connecting its positive and negative terminals, and place circuit elements along those wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention, <strong>current flows in the direction that positive charge would move</strong> - from the positive terminal of a battery, through the circuit elements, 
      and back to the negative terminal. Even though the actual charge carriers (electrons) move opposite to this direction, this convention simplifies calculations 
      and aligns with the definitions used in Kirchhoff's Laws and Ohm's Law.
    </p>

    <h2>Resistors</h2>
    <p>Resistors are very useful circuit components, and give us the starting point to building 
      more complex circuits. Resistors are essentially current throttles, they can limit 
      the amount of current flowing for a set voltage. If we consider a resistor with a set amount of 
      resistance, and a voltage supply with a set amount of voltage. Then by rearranging Ohm's Law, we have 
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      R = \frac{V}{I} \]
    </div>
    <p>In other words, if we increase the resistance, the current must decrease to maintain the relation. 
      Resistors dissipate electrical energy into heat. As mentioned in the previous page, this is via the 
      interaction between the current flow and atomic lattice. As the electrons drift, they bounce off of 
      the atomic lattice and transfer electrical energy to the lattice, increasing the heat of the metal. 
      They are designed to dissipate a certain amount of energy. 
      </p>
      <p>
      When multiple resistors are in a circuit, their arrangement affects the total resistance. 
      The two main arrangements are <strong>series</strong> and <strong>parallel</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Series Resistors</h3>
    <p>
      Resistors in series are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows through all of them. 
      The total voltage across all resistors is the sum of individual voltages:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
      \[ V_{\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + ... + V_n \]
    </div>
    <p>
      Their equivalent resistance is
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
      \[ R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n \]
    </div>

    <h3>Parallel Resistors</h3>
    <p>
      Resistors in parallel are connected across the same two nodes, so the voltage across each is the same. 
      The total current is the sum of the currents through each resistor:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
      \[ I_{\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n \]
    </div>
    <p>
      The equivalent resistance is
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">
      \[ \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n} \]
    </div>
