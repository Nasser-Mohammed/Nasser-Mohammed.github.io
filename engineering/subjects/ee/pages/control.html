  </header>

  <main>

  <p>
    Control theory is concerned with influencing the behavior of dynamical systems through
    external inputs. In electrical engineering, circuits naturally serve as controlled systems,
    with voltages or currents acting as inputs and measurable quantities such as voltages or
    currents acting as outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this perspective, control theory builds directly on the dynamical systems viewpoint.
    Once a circuit has been modeled using ordinary differential equations, control questions
    can be posed in a precise mathematical way.
  </p>

  <h2>Controlled Dynamical Systems</h2>

  <p>
    A controlled dynamical system may be written abstractly as
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t)),
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(x(t)\) represents the state of the system and \(u(t)\) represents an externally
    applied control input. In electrical circuits, the state typically consists of capacitor
    voltages and inductor currents, while the input may be a voltage or current source.
  </p>

  <h2>Linear Control Systems</h2>

  <p>
    When circuit elements obey linear constitutive relations, the resulting controlled system
    takes the form
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    where the matrix \(A\) encodes the internal dynamics of the circuit and the matrix \(B\)
    describes how inputs influence the state. This formulation is known as the
    <strong>state-space representation</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An output equation is often introduced,
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t),
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(y(t)\) represents a measured output of interest, such as a capacitor voltage or
    branch current.
  </p>

  <h2>Feedback Control</h2>

  <p>
    In feedback control, the input \(u(t)\) is chosen as a function of the system’s current
    state or output. A common choice is linear state feedback,
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    u(t) = -K x(t),
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    which yields the closed-loop system
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \dot{x}(t) = (A - BK)x(t).
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    By selecting the gain matrix \(K\), the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix
    \(A - BK\) may be shaped to achieve desired stability and performance properties.
  </p>

  <h2>Stability and Poles</h2>

  <p>
    Stability of an electrical control system is determined by the location of the system’s
    poles. In the state-space formulation, poles correspond to the eigenvalues of the system
    matrix. In the Laplace domain, they correspond to the roots of the characteristic equation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feedback control allows these poles to be shifted, enabling engineers to stabilize
    otherwise unstable circuits or modify transient response characteristics such as settling
    time and overshoot.
  </p>

  <h2>Control Interpretation of Circuits</h2>

  <p>
    Many familiar circuit behaviors can be reinterpreted through a control-theoretic lens.
    Resistance introduces damping, capacitance and inductance introduce energy storage, and
    feedback loops arise naturally in amplifiers, oscillators, and power electronics.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this viewpoint, circuit design becomes the problem of shaping system dynamics through
    feedback and input design rather than simply solving equations.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond Linear Control</h2>

  <p>
    When nonlinear elements are present, the system dynamics become nonlinear. Control theory
    still applies, but analysis typically relies on linearization, Lyapunov methods, or
    numerical simulation. The underlying state-space structure, however, remains unchanged.
  </p>

  <p>
    Control theory therefore provides a unifying framework connecting circuit analysis,
    dynamical systems, and system-level design.
