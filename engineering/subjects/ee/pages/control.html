      <h1>Control Theory</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Influencing Dynamical Systems through Feedback</p>

    <section class="bio-text">
      <p>
        Control theory is concerned with influencing the behavior of dynamical systems through
        external inputs. In electrical engineering, circuits naturally serve as controlled systems,
        with voltages or currents acting as inputs and measurable quantities such as voltages or
        currents acting as outputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this perspective, control theory builds directly on the dynamical systems viewpoint.
        Once a circuit has been modeled using ordinary differential equations, control questions
        can be posed in a precise mathematical way.
      </p>

      <h2>Controlled Dynamical Systems</h2>
      <p>
        A controlled dynamical system may be written abstractly as
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t)),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where \(x(t)\) represents the state of the system and \(u(t)\) represents an externally
        applied control input. In electrical circuits, the state typically consists of capacitor
        voltages and inductor currents, while the input may be a voltage or current source.
      </p>

      <h2>Linear Control Systems</h2>
      
      <p>
        When circuit elements obey linear constitutive relations, the resulting controlled system
        takes the form
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where the matrix \(A\) encodes the internal dynamics of the circuit and the matrix \(B\)
        describes how inputs influence the state. This formulation is known as the
        <strong>state-space representation</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An output equation is often introduced,
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        where \(y(t)\) represents a measured output of interest, such as a capacitor voltage or
        branch current.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback Control</h2>
      
      <p>
        In feedback control, the input \(u(t)\) is chosen as a function of the system’s current
        state or output. A common choice is linear state feedback,
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        u(t) = -K x(t),
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        which yields the closed-loop system
      </p>

      <div class="math-display">
      \[
        \dot{x}(t) = (A - BK)x(t).
      \]
      </div>

      <p>
        By selecting the gain matrix \(K\), the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix
        \(A - BK\) may be shaped to achieve desired stability and performance properties.
      </p>

      <h2>Stability and Poles</h2>
      <p>
        Stability of an electrical control system is determined by the location of the system’s
        poles. In the state-space formulation, poles correspond to the eigenvalues of the system
        matrix. In the Laplace domain, they correspond to the roots of the characteristic equation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feedback control allows these poles to be shifted, enabling engineers to stabilize
        otherwise unstable circuits or modify transient response characteristics such as settling
        time and overshoot.
      </p>

      <h2>Control Interpretation of Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        Many familiar circuit behaviors can be reinterpreted through a control-theoretic lens.
        Resistance introduces damping, capacitance and inductance introduce energy storage, and
        feedback loops arise naturally in amplifiers, oscillators, and power electronics.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this viewpoint, circuit design becomes the problem of shaping system dynamics through
        feedback and input design rather than simply solving equations.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Linear Control</h2>
      <p>
        When nonlinear elements are present, the system dynamics become nonlinear. Control theory
        still applies, but analysis typically relies on linearization, Lyapunov methods, or
        numerical simulation. The underlying state-space structure, however, remains unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Control theory therefore provides a unifying framework connecting circuit analysis,
        dynamical systems, and system-level design.
