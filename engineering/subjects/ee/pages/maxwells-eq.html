  <main>
    <p>
        As mentioned, Maxwell's Equations form the foundation of Electrical Engineering. This page explores the fundamental nature 
        of the system of PDEs that govern electromagnetic phenomena. First, we will examine each equation in roughly the order 
        they were discovered. At the end, we will combine them to reconstruct Maxwell's Equations.

        <h2>Coulomb's Law (1785)</h2>
        <p>
            In 1785, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb measured the force between static electric charges and discovered an 
            inverse-square relationship governing electrostatics. This is very similar to the formula governing the 
            gravitational force between two celestial bodies.
            </p>

            <div class="math-block">
            \[
            F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
            \]
            </div>

            <p>
            Where \(k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\) is <strong>Coulomb's constant</strong>. The key takeaway is that 
            this law is essentially analogous to <strong>Newton's Law of Gravitation</strong>, but for electric charges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are considered <strong>point charges</strong>, meaning they are idealized charges 
                with no spatial extent, so that the force acts along the line connecting them. Roughly speaking, an atom is 
                positively charged if it has more protons than electrons, negatively charged if it has more electrons than 
                protons, and neutral if it has the same number of protons and electrons. In our equation, this means that 
                when the signs of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are opposite, the product is negative, resulting in an attractive force. 
                Otherwise, the charges repel, consistent with physical reality. Later, Gauss generalized this law to 
                continuous charge distributions, giving it its modern differential form. However, what I showed 
                was only the <strong>magnitude</strong> of force. This does not necessarily give us a sense of
                direction in space. This force may very well be at an angle relative to a normal Cartesian coordinate 
                system. The positive vs. negative distinction gives us one piece of information , however, it's for the magnitude 
                of the force, not the direction of force. Furthermore, our point charge doesn't necessarily 
                need to be centered at the origin, we might want a more generalized form for different use cases.
                Therefore we must consider the vector form using a displacement vector, \(\vec{r}\). Now we know that 
            </p>

            <h2>Electric Fields Defined by Coulomb's Law</h2>
            <p>There's sort of two ways to look at an electric field, so we'll start with the first. 
              If we consider an electric monopole \(q_1\) (a single point charge), then we might want to 
              have a graphical representation of its effect on any point in space. This is where we get the 
              concept of an electric field. Denoted \(\textbf{E}\), the electric field is simply a vector field where 
              each point in space is assigned a vector representing the electric force per unit charge.
              This is an important distinction, because we can then use the electric field to determine the 
              actual effect on a charged particle \(q_2\) by simply scaling the vector at that point by \(q2\).
              In other words it gives us a general (and normalized) measurement for the effect of our source \(q_1\)
              on any point in space. The magnitude of the vector field at any point in space is given by,
            </p>
            <div class="math-block">\[
                k_e\frac{q_1}{r^2}
              \]
            </div>
            <p>A higher value of \(q_1\) creates a stronger electric field, and the field 
              is weaker further away from the source. However so far the field we described is only scalar and is not a vector field. To properly
              define a vector field we must have vectors. So since we defined the magnitude of the field at each point, we just 
              need to multiply it by its displacement vector. More specifically, the actual vector field 
            \(\vec{\textbf{E}}\) is given by</p>
            <div class="math-block">\[
                \vec{\textbf{E}} = k_{\epsilon}\frac{q_1}{r^2}\hat{r} = k_{\epsilon}\frac{q_1}{r^3}\vec{r}
              \]
            </div> 
            <p>These are equivalent since</p>
            <div class="math-block">\[
                \hat{r} = \frac{\vec{r}}{r}
              \]
            </div> 
              
              <p>
              Here, \(\vec{r}\) is the <strong>displacement vector</strong>. More specifically, 
              in three-dimensional coordinates, it is the vector difference between the position of the 
              field point \((x,y,z)\) and the position of the source charge \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\).
              </p>

              
              <p>If we ever want to determine the actual force that our source 
              exerts on another point charge \(q_2\), we simply multiply the magnitude of the vector at its position by 
              the charge of \(q_2\). In other words, 
            </p>
            <div class="math-block">\[
                  |F| = q_2\cdot|\vec{\textbf{E}}|
              \]
            </div>
            <p>Where we can determine \(r\) by the Euclidean distance,
            </p>
            <div class="math-block">\[
                  r = \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2} \implies r^2 = (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2
              \]
            </div>
            <p>Where \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) are the coordinates of the source charge. This basically defines the outline of a sphere of radius \(r\). So the source's effect on space 
              is radially symmetric (at least in this formulation with an idealized point charge).

        <h2>Ampère's Law (1820-1825)</h2>
        <p>
        Between 1820 and 1825, André-Marie Ampère studied the magnetic field produced by electric currents and formulated 
        the relationship between current and magnetic field. His results were built upon the seminal work of Ørsted.
        In its standard integral form, <strong>Ampère's Law</strong> is written as
      </p>
        <div class="math-block">\[
            \oint_C \textbf{B}\cdot dl = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}
          \]
        </div>
        <p>Let's interpret this. Imagine we had a wire carrying a current \(I\), then </p>

        <h2>Faraday's Law of Induction (1831)</h2>
        <p>
        In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered experimentally that a changing magnetic field induces an electric current.
        </p>

        <h2>Gauss's Laws (1830s-1845)</h2>
        <p>
        From the 1830s to 1845, Carl Friedrich Gauss formulated Gauss's Law for electricity, relating electric fields 
        to charge distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>Ampère-Maxwell Law (1861-1862)</h2>
        <p>
        Between 1861 and 1862, Maxwell identified inconsistencies in Ampère's Law under certain scenarios, such as a charging capacitor. 
        He introduced the <strong>displacement current</strong> to resolve this, making the law consistent with charge conservation.
        </p>

        <h2>Maxwell's Synthesis (1860s)</h2>
        <p>
        Maxwell then compiled the four laws into a unified system of PDEs. Later, Oliver Heaviside reformulated them in the vector 
        notation we use today.
