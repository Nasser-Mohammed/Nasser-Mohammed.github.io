  <main>
    <p>
        As mentioned, Maxwell's Equations form the foundation of Electrical Engineering. This page explores the fundamental nature 
        of the system of PDEs that govern electromagnetic phenomena. First, we will examine each PDE in roughly the order 
        they were discovered. At the end, we will combine them to reconstruct Maxwell's Equations.

        <h2>Coulomb's Law (1785)</h2>
        <p>
            In 1785, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb measured the force between static electric charges and discovered an 
            inverse-square relationship governing electrostatics. This is very similar to the formula governing the 
            gravitational force between two celestial bodies.
            </p>

            <div class="math-block">
            \[
            F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
            \]
            </div>

            <p>
            Where \(k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\) is <strong>Coulomb's constant</strong>. The key takeaway is that 
            this law is essentially analogous to <strong>Newton's Law of Gravitation</strong>, but for electric charges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are considered <strong>point charges</strong>, meaning they are idealized charges 
                with no spatial extent, so that the force acts along the line connecting them. Roughly speaking, an atom is 
                positively charged if it has more protons than electrons, negatively charged if it has more electrons than 
                protons, and neutral if it has the same number of protons and electrons. In our equation, this means that 
                when the signs of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are opposite, the product is negative, resulting in an attractive force. 
                Otherwise, the charges repel, consistent with physical reality. Later, Gauss generalized this law to 
                continuous charge distributions, giving it its modern differential form.
        </p>


        <h2>Ampère's Law (1820-1825)</h2>
        <p>
        Between 1820 and 1825, André-Marie Ampère studied the magnetic field produced by electric currents and formulated 
        the relationship between current and magnetic field.
        </p>

        <h2>Faraday's Law of Induction (1831)</h2>
        <p>
        In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered experimentally that a changing magnetic field induces an electric current.
        </p>

        <h2>Gauss's Laws (1830s-1845)</h2>
        <p>
        From the 1830s to 1845, Carl Friedrich Gauss formulated Gauss's Law for electricity, relating electric fields 
        to charge distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>Ampère-Maxwell Law (1861-1862)</h2>
        <p>
        Between 1861 and 1862, Maxwell identified inconsistencies in Ampère's Law under certain scenarios, such as a charging capacitor. 
        He introduced the <strong>displacement current</strong> to resolve this, making the law consistent with charge conservation.
        </p>

        <h2>Maxwell's Synthesis (1860s)</h2>
        <p>
        Maxwell then compiled the four laws into a unified system of PDEs. Later, Oliver Heaviside reformulated them in the vector 
        notation we use today.
