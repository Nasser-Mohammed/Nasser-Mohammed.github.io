  <main>

  <p>
    RC circuits introduced first-order dynamics and exponential relaxation due to energy dissipation.
    By adding an inductor, we obtain RLC circuits, which are the simplest electrical systems capable
    of oscillatory behavior. In these circuits, energy is exchanged between electric and magnetic
    fields while resistive elements dissipate energy as heat.
  </p>

  <h2>Inductors</h2>
  <p>
    An inductor is a circuit element that stores energy in a magnetic field. Physically, inductors
    resist changes in current, since a changing current produces a changing magnetic field, which
    induces a voltage opposing that change.
  </p>

  <p>
    The voltage across an inductor is given by
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    V_L = L \frac{dI}{dt},
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(L\) is the inductance, measured in henries (H). The energy stored in an inductor is
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    E_L = \tfrac{1}{2} L I^2.
  \]
  </div>

  <h2>LC Circuits</h2>
  <p>
    Before introducing resistance, it is useful to consider an ideal LC circuit. In this case,
    energy oscillates between the electric field of the capacitor and the magnetic field of the
    inductor without loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \(Q(t)\) denote the charge on the capacitor. Applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law gives
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    L\frac{d^2 Q}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{C} Q = 0.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    This equation describes simple harmonic motion with natural frequency
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    In an ideal LC circuit, the total energy remains constant and oscillates between electric and
    magnetic forms.
  </p>

  <h2>RLC Circuits</h2>
  <p>
    Real circuits contain resistance, which dissipates energy and damps oscillations. Including a
    resistor in series with the inductor and capacitor leads to the RLC circuit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law yields the governing equation
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    L\frac{d^2 Q}{dt^2} + R\frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} Q = 0.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    This is a second-order linear differential equation analogous to the equation of motion for a
    damped mass–spring system. The resistor plays the role of damping, while the inductor and
    capacitor correspond to inertia and restoring force, respectively.
  </p>

  <h2>Damping Regimes</h2>
  <p>
    The qualitative behavior of an RLC circuit depends on the relative strength of resistance. Define
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
    \alpha = \frac{R}{2L},
    \qquad
    \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
    The system exhibits three distinct regimes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Underdamped</strong> (\(\alpha < \omega_0\)): oscillatory behavior with exponentially
      decaying amplitude.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Critically damped</strong> (\(\alpha = \omega_0\)): fastest return to equilibrium
      without oscillation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Overdamped</strong> (\(\alpha > \omega_0\)): slow, non-oscillatory return to equilibrium.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These damping regimes appear throughout physics and engineering and play a central role in
    circuit design, control systems, and signal processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    RLC circuits therefore provide a canonical example of second-order linear dynamical systems,
    illustrating how energy storage, dissipation, and oscillation interact in physical systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Inductors in Series and Parallel</h2>

  <p>
  When multiple inductors are connected together, their arrangement determines the effective
  inductance seen by the circuit. This affects how strongly the circuit resists changes in current
  and therefore influences the overall dynamics.
  </p>

  <h3>Inductors in Series</h3>
  <p>
  Inductors connected end-to-end carry the same current. The total voltage across the series
  combination is the sum of the individual voltages, leading to an equivalent inductance
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
  L_{\text{eq}} = L_1 + L_2 + \dots + L_n.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
  Series inductors increase the total inductance, making changes in current more difficult.
  </p>

  <h3>Inductors in Parallel</h3>
  <p>
  Inductors connected in parallel experience the same voltage, while the current divides among the
  branches. The equivalent inductance is given by
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">
  \[
  \frac{1}{L_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{L_n}.
  \]
  </div>

  <p>
  Parallel inductors reduce the effective inductance, allowing current to change more easily.
