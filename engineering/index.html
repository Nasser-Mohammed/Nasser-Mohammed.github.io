    The topics below represent physics and the core engineering disciplines, with the exclusion of Software and Chemical Engineering, as I will first
     need to go back and learn Organic Chemistry for the latter, and my website and animations are a display of the former.
    As it turns out, it's not terribly difficult to understand any of the concepts in these fields coming from a math background. 
    I cover the concepts I find the most interesting and know the best. Electrical engineering will have the most content as 
    I am most familiar with it. It will primarily include Maxwell's equations, circuits, control systems, communications, RF, signal processing, and embedded programming. 
    Physics will contain Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, 
    relativity, and quantum mechanics. 
    Mechanical engineering and aerospace will primarily contain fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and propulsion. Civil engineering will primarily 
    contain structural engineering concepts.
