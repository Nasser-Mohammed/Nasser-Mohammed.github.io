    The topics below represent the core engineering disciplines, with the exclusion of Chemical Engineering as I will need to go back and learn Organic Chemistry first.
    As it turns out, it's not terribly difficult to understand any of the concepts in these fields coming from a math and physics background. 
    I cover the concepts I find the most interesting and know the best. Electrical engineering will have the most content as 
    I am most familiar with it. It will primarily include circuits, control systems, communications, RF, signal processing, and embedded programming. 
    Mechanical engineering and aerospace will primarily contain fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and propulsion. Civil engineering will primarily 
    contain structural engineering concepts.
