    <h1>The Non-Homogenous Heat Equation</h1>
  </header>
<hr style="border: 2px solid black;">
\[u_t=\alpha^2u_{xx} + f(x,t)\] 

We consider the standard 1-D heat equation with an inhomogeneity of \(f(x,t)\). The idea, is to write this inhomogeneity \(f(x,t)\) as a sin-series (also called its Fourier Series), as well as rewriting \(u(x,t)\) as a sin-series. Once we rewrite the PDE in this way, we can make some observations that allow us to solve the problem. It will become clear that we can sort of "push" the inhomogeneity onto an ODE in \(T\). As mentioned, rewriting everything in terms of their Fourier Series, we have
\[u(x,t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(t)X_n(x)\]
\[f(x,t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}f_n(t)X_n(x)\]
Since the \(X_n(x)\) comes from solving the homogenous version of PDE, \(X_n(x) = \sin(n\pi x)\), and since we are writing \(f(x,t)\) as its Fourier Series, we can just replace the \(\sin(n\pi x)\) (from the Fourier Series representation) with \(X_n(x)\). Now let's compute the partial derivatives, 
\[u_t = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n^{\'}(t)X_n(x)\]
\[u_{xx} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(t)X_n^{\''}(x)\]
Plugging all of this into our PDE we get,
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n^{\'}(t)X_n(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(t)X_n^{\''}(x) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}f_n(t)X_n(x)\]
Now moving everything to one side,
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n^{\'}X_n(x) - \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(t)X_n^{\''}(x) - \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}f_n(t)X_n(x) = 0\]
We can pull the summation out to get,
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n^{\'}X_n(x) - T_n(t)X_n^{\''}(x) - f_n(t)X_n(x) = 0\]
We note here, that \(X_n(x) = \sin(n\pi x) \implies X_n^{\''} = (n\pi)^2\sin(n\pi x)\). So plugging these into the equation above we arrive at, 
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n^{\'}\sin(n\pi x) - T_n(t)(n\pi)^2\sin(n\pi x) - f_n(t)\sin(n\pi x) = 0\]
And pulling out the \(\sin(n\pi x)\) term we get
\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\[T_n^{\'} - T_n(t)(n\pi)^2 - f_n(t)\]\sin(n\pi x) = 0\]
The sequence of functions \(\sin(n\pi x)\) forms an [orthogonal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_basis). Without going into much detail, this says that for any function \(g(t)\), then \(g(t)\sin(n\pi x) = 0 \implies  g(t) = 0\). Applying this to our equation, \(T_n^{\'} - T_n(t)(n\pi)^2 - f_n(t)\) is the function that must be 0. So we can set \[T_n^{\'} - T_n(t)(n\pi)^2 - f_n(t) = 0\] Since we know this must be true. In doing this, we arrive at a non-homogenous ODE, in T. However, we have tools to solve non-homogenous ODEs, such as an [integrating factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrating_factor) or through [method of undetermined coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_undetermined_coefficients) (among other ways, but these are most common). 
However, I have skipped over some steps, like how do we find the values \(f_n(t)\)? It turns out, we again use the orthogonality of \(\sin(n\pi x)\), first we know
\[f(x,t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}f_n(t)sin(n\pi x)\]
Then as before, multiplying both sides by \(\sin(m\pi x)\) and integrating from 0 to 1 (with respect to \(x\)) will eliminate most of the right side, leaving \(\frac{1}{2}f_n(t)\). If you do not see why, go back to the original [heat equation](heatequation.md) page, where I go through the derivation of this. So we now have an expression for \(f_n(t)\)
\[f_n(t) = 2\int_0^1f(x,t)sin(n\pi x)dx\]
So, for each \(n\), we can solve the ODE since we have our corresponding \(f_n(t)\). There is one more consideration, the initial condition. We are given the initial condition as a function typically (not a series), so we will substitute \(u(0, x)\) with its Fourier sin-series
\[u(x, 0) = \phi(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(0)X_n(x)\]
Again, carrying out the process of multiplying by a factor of \(\sin(m\pi x)\) and integrating from 0 to 1 with respect to \(x\), we get that
\[T_n(0) = 2\int_0^1\phi(x)sin(n\pi x)\]
Then we now have a way to compute the necessary initial condition for the \(n^{th} \text{ ODE in } T\).
Once we solve for each \(T_n(t)\) we then have \[u(x,t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}T_n(t)\sin(n\pi x)\]
As our final solution, where the \(T_n(t)\)s are solved by the above process.
