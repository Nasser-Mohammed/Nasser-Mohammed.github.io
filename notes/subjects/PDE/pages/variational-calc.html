We seek a method of minimizing/maximizing **functionals** instead of a normal function. If you do not know what a functional is, it is more or less a function that takes in another **function** and outputs a **scalar** (a number). In other words, it takes in a function and evaluates it in some way. The most familiar functional is the integral (more specifically the definite integral since the indefinite integral gives us a function back). For example
\[J\[y\] = \int_a^b F(x,y,y')dx\]
Is a functional, since it takes in a function \(F(x,y,y')\) and returns a value for it. Here, \(y\) is a function of \(x\), so our functional is taking in a function of \(y\), which is why we have \(J\[y\]\). What we are interested in, like in standard optimization, is finding how to minimize (maximize in some situations but we will consider minimization) this functional. In other words, we seek a function \(\overline{y}(x)\) that minimizes the output of \(J\[y\]\). This can be thought of as minimizing the time it takes to travel some path with only gravity as force. If you have not recognized, this is simply the *Brachistochrone problem* (introduced in 1696 by John Bernoulli). 
![Self Drawn Brachistochrone Problem](brachi.png)
Now, Bernoulli also derived the following function to determine the time is takes for an object to slide down a frictionless path with gravity. It is defined as
\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2g}}\int_a^b\sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{y}}dx\]
Now that we can see that this is a functional, we can use the techniques below to find the function for \(y\) that minimizes the time.

General Theory
===
Like in calculus where we find the min and max of a function by setting the derivative of thefunction equal to 0, here we set the derivative of the function equal to 0 but not quite in the same way. In the standard way of minimizing a function, for a function \(g(x)\), we set \(g'(x) = 0\) and solve for the **\(x\)** values that produce 0 for the derivative. In other words, we are taking the inverse of the function to find the set of \(x\) values that produce 0 for the derivative. In our scenario, we are not looking for values that satisfy this, but rather **functions** that satisfy the equality. In other words we have an ODE 
\[\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 0\]
This is called **the Euler-Lagrange Equation**. The problem will lie in finding the solution to this ODE in various cases. For the functional
\[J\[y\] = \int_a^bF(x,y,y')dx\]
We are looking for the \(y(x)\) that minimizes the functional and satisfies the boundary conditions 
\[y(a) = A\]
and
\[y(b) = B\]
Where \(A\) and \(B\) are just some constants. As mentioned, the goal is to find (we will now denote it) \(\overline{y}(x)\) that minimizes our functional. Now we introduce a "small" deviation from \(\overline{y}(x)\), we consider
\[\overline{y}(x) + \varepsilon \eta (x)\]
We typically consider \(\varepsilon\) a very small number but usually in the range \((0,1)\). \(\eta (x)\) is just some smooth curve that handles (satisfies) the boundary conditions \(\eta (a) = \eta (b) = 0\). Here we find an important inequality
\[J\[\overline{y}\] \leq J\[\overline{y} + \varepsilon \eta \]\]
Now if we consider \(\phi(\varepsilon) = J\[\overline{y} + \varepsilon \eta \]\), then we know that to find \(\overline{y}\), we minimize \(\phi(\varepsilon)\). If this isn't obvious, just consider our inequality, above, minimizing \(\phi(\varepsilon)\) will bring us to the function \(\overline{y}\) since we know that 
\[J\[\overline{y}\] \leq J\[\overline{y} + \varepsilon \eta \]\]
So at the lower extremity for \(\phi (\epsilon)\), our functionals will match and \(\overline{y}\) will be equal to the function that we find by minimizing \(\phi(\varepsilon)\). So we do the standard process of taking the derivative (with respect to \(\varepsilon\)) and **evaluating it at** \(\varepsilon = 0\) and set it equal to 0.
\[\frac{d\phi(\varepsilon)}{d\varepsilon} = \frac{d}{d\varepsilon}J\[\overline{y} + \varepsilon \eta\]\]
Now evaluating this at \(\varepsilon = 0\) 
\[\int_a^b \left\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}}\eta(x) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial (\overline{y})^{\'}}\eta^{\'}(x)\right\]dx\]
Integration by parts yields
\[\int_a^b \left\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}} - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial (\overline{y})^{\'}}\right) \right\]\eta (x)dx = 0\]
Here we note that this integral must be 0 **for any function** \(\eta (x)\) that is smooth and satisfies the boundary conditions. What this means, is that the rest of the integrand, 
\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}} - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}'}\right)\]
**Must** be 0, so setting this equal to 0 we get
\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}} - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \overline{y}'}\right) = 0\]
And as mentioned earlier, this is the **Euler-Lagrange Equation**. This is a second order ODE in \(\overline{y}\). Solving this ODE will give us our minimum function \(\overline{y}\). In other words, to paraphrase *Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers* by Stanley Farlow

<div style="text-align: center;">
\(
\text{If y minimizes } J[y] = \int_a^bF(x,y,y')dx \implies y \text{ must satisfy the equation: } \
\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'}\right) = 0
\)
</div>


Example Problem
===
Consider the functional 
\[J\[y\] = \int_0^1\left(y^2+(y')^2\right)dx\]
Where we want to find the minimizer \(y(x)\) through the points \((0,0)\) and \((2,2)\). We begin by writing the associated Euler-Lagrange equation.
\[F_y - \frac{d}{dx}F_y = 0\]
Our BCs to consider are \(y(0) = 0\) and \(y(2) = 2\). In our scenario, \(F(x,y,y') = y^2 + (y')^2\), so computing the partial derivatives gives
\[F_y = 2y\]
\[F_{y'} = 2y'\]
So our Euler-Lagrange equation becomes
\[2y - \frac{d}{dx}(2y') = 0\]
This simplifies to 
\[y^{\''} - y = 0\]
The characteristic equation for this is
\[\lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \sqrt{1} \implies \lambda_1 = 1, \lambda_2 = -1\]
Since we have two real roots, our solution will be 
\[y(x) = Ae^{\lambda_1 x} + Be^{\lambda_2 x} = Ae^{x} + Be^{-x}\]
Recall our boundary conditions are \(y(0) = 0, y(2) = 2\). Plugging these in we get:
\[y(0) = A + B = 0 \implies A = - B\]
Plugging in our other BC we get:
\[y(2) = Ae^{2} + Be^{-2} = 2\]
Substituting \(-B\) in for \(A\) yields:
\[-Be^{2} + Be^{-2} = 2 \implies B = \frac{2}{-e^{2}+e^{-2}} \approx -0.28 \implies B = -0.28\]
Since we know \(A = -B\), we have our final solution
\[y(x) = 0.28e^{x} - 0.28e^{-x}\]
Which we can write as
\[y(x) = 0.28e^{x} - \frac{0.28}{e^{x}}\]
This function minimizes the functional: 
\[J\[y\] = \int_0^1\left(y^2+(y')^2\right)dx\]
