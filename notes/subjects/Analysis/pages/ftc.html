      <h1 class="title">The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus with the Lebesgue Integral</h1>
  </header>
<main>
  <p>
    Most people are familiar with the inverse relationship between the integral operation and the derivative, referred to as 
    <strong>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</strong>. We are typically introduced to this relationship in a first term calculus course. 
    I will provide a more rigorous outline of this relationship, with the Lebesgue integral, and show that it (under certain circumstances) still obeys this relationship. 
    Really there are two statements to consider (and for me to prove). I will state them both and then resolve them in order.
  </p>

  <h2>What to Consider</h2>
  <p>
    The first question: does integrability on an interval imply the existence of a derivative? Additionally, does the derivative of the integrated function return the unintegrated function? More formally:
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \text{If \(f\) is an integrable function on } [a,b], \quad F(x) = \int_a^x f(y)\,dy,
  \]</div>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \text{can we conclude that } F'(x) \text{ exists, and that } F'(x)=f(x) \text{ (at least for a.e. } x)?
  \]</div>

  <p>
    The second question flips this: what restrictions on a function \(F\) defined on \([a,b]\) guarantee that the derivative exists almost everywhere, is integrable, and that
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    F(b)-F(a)=\int_a^b F'(x)\,dx ?
  \]</div>

  <h2>The Derivative of an Integral and the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem</h2>
  <p>We define</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    F(x)=\int_a^x f(y)\,dy, \qquad a\le x\le b.
  \]</div>
  <p>
    To see if the derivative exists, use the definition:
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    F'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}
          = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h} f(y)\,dy.
  \]</div>
  <p>
    Interpreting the interval \([x,x+h]\) as a “ball” \(B\) with measure \(m(B)=h\), we can rewrite
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B f(y)\,dy.
  \]</div>
  <p>
    This raises the <strong>averaging problem</strong>: does the average value over shrinking neighborhoods converge to \(f(x)\)?
  </p>

  <h3>Continuous Case</h3>
  <p>If \(f\) is continuous, then indeed</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B f(y)\,dy = f(x).
  \]</div>
  <p>
    The proof follows from continuity, rewriting the difference as 
    \(\tfrac{1}{m(B)}\int_B(f(y)-f(x))dy\), and applying the triangle inequality.
  </p>

  <h3>The General Case</h3>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem</strong><br>
    If \(f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\), then
    \[
      \lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B f(y)\,dy = f(x)
    \]
    for almost every \(x\).
  </div>

  <p>
    Thus, the derivative of the integral recovers the original function almost everywhere, provided \(f\) is integrable.
  </p>

  <h3>Local Integrability and Density</h3>
  <p>
    Local integrability (\(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^d)\)) suffices, since behavior at infinity does not affect averages on finite balls. 
    This leads to notions of density and Lebesgue sets.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Lebesgue Density Theorem</strong><br>
    For a measurable set \(E\subset\mathbb{R}^d\), almost every point of \(E\) is a point of density of \(E\), and almost every point not in \(E\) is not a point of density.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Lebesgue Set</strong><br>
    For \(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}\), the Lebesgue set of \(f\) is the set of points \(x\) such that
    \[
      \lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B |f(y)-f(x)|\,dy = 0.
    \]
    Almost every point in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) belongs to the Lebesgue set of \(f\).
  </div>

  <h2>The Integral of a Differentiated Function</h2>
  <p>
    We now consider when
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    F(b)-F(a)=\int_a^b F'(x)\,dx
  \]</div>
  <p>
    holds. Not all continuous functions are differentiable everywhere (e.g. the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function">Weierstrass function</a>). 
    We need conditions ensuring differentiability and integrability of \(F'\).
  </p>

  <h3>Bounded Variation</h3>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Definition (Bounded Variation)</strong>  
    \(F\) has bounded variation on \([a,b]\) if
    \[
      \sum_{j=1}^N |F(t_j)-F(t_{j-1})| \le M
    \]
    for all partitions  \(a=t_0&lt;\cdots&lt;t_N=b\).
  </div>

  <p>
    Functions of bounded variation are differentiable a.e., but the equality above may fail (e.g. the Cantor function).
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Differentiation Existence Theorem</strong><br>
    If \(F\) has bounded variation on \([a,b]\), then \(F'(x)\) exists for almost every \(x\).
  </div>

  <p>
    However, one only obtains
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \int_a^b F'(x)\,dx \le F(b)-F(a)
  \]</div>

  <h3>Absolute Continuity</h3>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Absolute Continuity</strong><br>
    \(F\) is absolutely continuous on \([a,b]\) if for every \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists \(\delta>0\) such that
    \[
      \sum (b_k-a_k)<\delta \;\Rightarrow\; \sum |F(b_k)-F(a_k)|<\varepsilon
    \]
    for any finite disjoint collection of intervals.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Theorem (Integral of the Derivative)</strong><br>
    If \(F\) is absolutely continuous, then \(F'\) exists a.e., \(F'\in L^1\), and
    \[
      F(x)-F(a)=\int_a^x F'(y)\,dy, \quad a\le x\le b
    \]
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus splits into two directions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Differentiating an integral: for \(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}\), \(F'(x)=f(x)\) almost everywhere (Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem).</li>
    <li>Integrating a derivative: if \(F\) is absolutely continuous, then \(F(b)-F(a)=\int_a^b F'(x)\,dx\).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bounded variation guarantees a.e. differentiability but not full equality, while absolute continuity provides the exact condition. 
    This completes the rigorous version of the FTC in the Lebesgue setting.
