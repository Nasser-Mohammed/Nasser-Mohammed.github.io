      <p>
        Most people are familiar with the inverse relationship between the integral operation and the derivative, referred to as 
        <strong>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</strong>. We are typically introduced to this relationship in a first term calculus course. 
        I will provide a more rigorous outline of this relationship, with the Lebesgue integral, and show that it (under certain circumstances) still obeys this relationship. 
        Really there are two statements to consider. I will state them both and then resolve them in order.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Consider</h2>
      <p>
        The first question: does integrability on an interval imply the existence of a derivative? Additionally, does the derivative of the integrated function return the unintegrated function? More formally:
      </p>
      
      <div class="archive-box">
        <p>If \(f\) is an integrable function on \([a,b]\) and \(F(x) = \int_a^x f(y)\,dy\), can we conclude that \(F'(x)\) exists, and that \(F'(x)=f(x)\) (at least for a.e. \(x\))?</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The second question flips this: what restrictions on a function \(F\) defined on \([a,b]\) guarantee that the derivative exists almost everywhere, is integrable, and that
      </p>
      <div class="math-display">
        \[F(b)-F(a)=\int_a^b F'(x)\,dx?\]
      </div>

      <h2>The Derivative of an Integral</h2>
      <p>We define:</p>
      <div class="math-display">
        \[F(x)=\int_a^x f(y)\,dy, \qquad a\le x\le b.\]
      </div>
      <p>To see if the derivative exists, we use the definition:</p>
      <div class="math-display">
        \[F'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h} f(y)\,dy.\]
      </div>
      <p>
        Interpreting the interval \([x,x+h]\) as a “ball” \(B\) with measure \(m(B)=h\), we can rewrite this as the <strong>averaging problem</strong>: does the average value over shrinking neighborhoods converge to \(f(x)\)?
      </p>

      

      <h3>The Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem</h3>
      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If \(f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\), then</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          \[\lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B f(y)\,dy = f(x)\]
        </div>
        <p>for almost every \(x\).</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Thus, the derivative of the integral recovers the original function almost everywhere, provided \(f\) is integrable. Behavior at infinity does not affect averages on finite balls, meaning local integrability (\(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}\)) suffices.
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <h3>The Lebesgue Set</h3>
        <p>For \(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}\), the Lebesgue set of \(f\) is the set of points \(x\) such that:</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          \[\lim_{m(B)\to 0}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B |f(y)-f(x)|\,dy = 0.\]
        </div>
        <p>Almost every point in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) belongs to the Lebesgue set of \(f\).</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Integral of a Differentiated Function</h2>
      <p>
        We now consider the second direction. Not all continuous functions are differentiable everywhere (e.g., the Weierstrass function). We need specific conditions to ensure \(F(b)-F(a)=\int_a^b F'(x)\,dx\).
      </p>

      <h3>Bounded Variation vs. Absolute Continuity</h3>
      <p>
        A function has <strong>Bounded Variation</strong> if the sum of its oscillations is finite. While such functions are differentiable a.e., they may still fail the FTC (like the Cantor "Devil's Staircase" function).
      </p>
      
      

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Absolute Continuity:</strong> \(F\) is absolutely continuous on \([a,b]\) if for every \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists \(\delta>0\) such that</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          \[\sum (b_k-a_k)<\delta \;\Rightarrow\; \sum |F(b_k)-F(a_k)|<\varepsilon\]
        </div>
        <p>for any finite disjoint collection of intervals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Theorem (Integral of the Derivative):</strong> If \(F\) is absolutely continuous, then \(F'\) exists a.e., \(F'\in L^1\), and:</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          \[F(x)-F(a)=\int_a^x F'(y)\,dy, \quad a\le x\le b\]
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Differentiating an integral:</strong> For \(f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}\), \(F'(x)=f(x)\) almost everywhere via the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrating a derivative:</strong> If \(F\) is absolutely continuous, the fundamental relationship is preserved exactly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bounded variation:</strong> Guarantees a.e. differentiability, but only provides an inequality (\(\le\)) rather than full equality.</li>
      </ul>
