    <section class="bio-text">
      <p>
        The Lebesgue Measure was introduced to generalize our intuition of <em>sizes</em> to subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) (Euclidean Space). Our intuition of sizes naturally comes from known geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and cubes. We "cover" these subsets with these shapes and calculate the <em>size</em> of the sets based on the shapes that cover them.
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> Every open subset \(\mathbb{O}\) of \(\mathbb{R}\) can be written <strong>uniquely</strong> as a countable union of disjoint intervals.</p>
        <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> Every open subset \(\mathbb{O}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (\(d \ge 1\)) can be written as a countable union of almost disjoint closed cubes.</p>
        <p><em>Note:</em> "Almost disjoint" means the interiors are disjoint, though boundaries may overlap.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Size of Intervals and Basic Shapes</h2>
      <p>
        A closed rectangle \(R\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is defined by the product of intervals: \(R = [a_1, b_1]\times[a_2, b_2]\times\dots\times[a_d, b_d]\). The size of each interval is \(b_j - a_j\). The volume \(\left| R \right|\) is the product of these lengths.
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> If \(R \subset \bigcup_{j = 1}^N R_j\), then \(\left| R \right| \leq \sum_{j = 1}^N \left| R_j\right|\).</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Exterior Measure</h2>
      <p>
        The exterior measure assigns a size to <strong>any</strong> subset \(E\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) by covering it with shapes from the outside. Formally, the exterior measure \(m_{\ast}\) is defined as:
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <div class="math-display">
          \[m_{\ast}(E) = \inf \left\{ \sum_{j = 1}^{\infty}\left| Q_j \right| : E \subset \bigcup_{j = 1}^{\infty} Q_j \right\}\]
        </div>
        <p>where \(Q_j\) represents closed cubes.</p>
      </div>

      

      <p>Main observations regarding exterior measure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monotonicity:</strong> If \(E_1 \subset E_2\) then \(m_{\ast}(E_1) \leq m_{\ast}(E_2)\).</li>
        <li><strong>Countable Sub-Additivity:</strong> If \(E = \bigcup_{j = 1}^{\infty} E_j\), then \(m_{\ast}(E) \leq \sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} m_{\ast}(E_j)\).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Counterintuitive Sub-Additivity</h3>
      <p>
        Because we approximate from the outside, a set like \(E = [0,3]\) can be written as \(\bigcup_{j = 1}^{\infty}(0, 3-\tfrac{1}{j})\). Even though the sum of the measures of these subsets might approach infinity in some contexts, the exterior measure of the union remains 3. This confirms that \(m_{\ast}(E) \leq \sum m_{\ast}(E_j)\), but equality is not guaranteed without further restrictions.
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Additivity conditions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If \(E = \bigcup Q_j\) (almost disjoint cubes), then \(m_{\ast}(E) = \sum \left|Q_j\right|\).</li>
          <li>If \(d(E_1, E_2) > 0\), then \(m_{\ast}(E_1 \cup E_2) = m_{\ast}(E_1) + m_{\ast}(E_2)\).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Measurability of Sets</h2>
      <p>
        We restrict the exterior measure to a \(\sigma\)-algebra called <strong>Lebesgue Measurable Sets</strong>, where the measure becomes countably additive.
      </p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A set \(\mathbb{E}\) is measurable if \(\forall \epsilon > 0\), there exists an open set \(\mathbb{O}\) with \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{O}\) such that \(m_{\ast}(\mathbb{O} - \mathbb{E}) \leq \epsilon\).</p>
      </div>

      <p>Basic measurable sets include closed sets, open sets, and null sets (measure 0). Countable unions and intersections of these are also measurable, leading to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>\(G_{\delta}\):</strong> Countable intersection of open sets.</li>
        <li><strong>\(F_{\sigma}\):</strong> Countable union of closed sets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Measurability of Functions</h2>
      <p>Measurable functions are the building blocks of modern integration theory.</p>

      <div class="archive-box">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A function \(f\) on measurable set \(E\) is measurable if \(\forall a \in \mathbb{R}\), the set \(\{x \in E: f(x) < a\}\) is measurable.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>characteristic function</strong> \(\chi_E(x)\) (which is 1 if \(x \in E\) and 0 otherwise) allows us to build <strong>simple functions</strong>:</p>
      <div class="math-display">
        \[f = \sum_{k = 1}^{M} a_k \chi_{E_k}\]
      </div>

      <h3>Properties & Convergence</h3>
      <p>In Lebesgue Theory, we often use the term <strong>almost everywhere (a.e.)</strong>, meaning a property holds except on a set of measure zero.</p>
      
      <div class="archive-box">
        <ul>
          <li>Limits of sequences of measurable functions are measurable.</li>
          <li>If \(f = g\) a.e. and \(f\) is measurable, then \(g\) is measurable.</li>
          <li><strong>Fundamental Result:</strong> Any measurable function \(f\) is the pointwise limit of a sequence of simple functions \(\{\phi_k\}\).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        This overview omits highly pathological cases like the Vitali Set or Egorov's Theorem, but establishes the framework for \(L^p\) spaces and robust integration.
