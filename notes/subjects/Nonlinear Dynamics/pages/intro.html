    <p>
      All of the differential equations that are solved in a first or even second semester differential equations course
      have <strong>analytic</strong> solutions.
      The differential equations that you solve are carefully crafted for you to do some basic algebraic manipulation and use some basic calculus to solve. 
      However, the vast majority of differential equations have no analytic solutions, so the techniques you learned will not be of any use.
      So if we can't get a closed form solution for the differential equations that govern the natural world, how do we understand the natural world?
      This is the focus of the study of nonlinear dynamics, as almost any differential equation that models something
      complex will be nonlinear, and pretty much any nonlinear ODE has no analytic solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Example</h2>
    <p>
      One of the simplest examples of a nonlinear ODE, is the simple pendulum.
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L}\sin(\theta) = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>This is easily derived using Newton's second law. This models a pendulum with no air resistance.
        If we limit our investigation to small angles (i.e. small values for \(\theta\)), then we can often
        substitute \(\sin\) for \(\theta\) in the differential equation since
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        \sin(\theta) \approx \theta
        \]
    </div>
    <p>Then our ODE would become</p>
        <div class="math-block">\[
        \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L}\theta = 0
        \]
    </div>

    <p>This turns the nonlinear ODE into a linear one with an analytic solution. But this is a limiting view of 
        a real physical model. Instead if we wanted to model the behavior for any \(\theta\), then there is no 
        analytic solution. This shows how limited linear ODEs are, they cannot even properly model something as 
        basic as the motion of a pendulum. However, this also demonstrates how important Nonlinear theory is.
