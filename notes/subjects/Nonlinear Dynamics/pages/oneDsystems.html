      Now that we have shown that any higher order ODEs can be reduced into a system of first order ODEs, the ability to analyze
      first order ODEs is obviously important. The first step in this process is <strong>fixed point analysis</strong>.
    </p>

  <h2>Fixed Point Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned, we can analyze systems of autonomous first order ODEs individually at first. We begin with the aforementioned
      <strong>fixed point analysis.</strong>. First let's consider such a system,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          \dot{x} = f(x)
    \]</div>
    <p>The <strong>fixed points</strong>, are the points \(x^*\) such that</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          f(x^*) = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>Since the right hand side of these systems are algebraic, it is often pretty straightforward to find these points. 
      It's not always easy to find it analytically, but numerical approximations can work as well.
    </p>
    <p>Now what does it mean for our system when \(f(x) = 0\)? This means that our state variable \(x\) is not changing.
      That is, the derivative (instantaneous rate of change) is \(0\) and will stay \(0\). Since,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          \dot{x} = f(x^*) = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>Finding this point is simply finding the value of \(x\) at which the state will never move. This is why it's called a fixed point.
      Due to our uniqueness and existence theorems, we know that no other trajectory can ever intersect the fixed point. This is due
      to the fact that there is a trajectory starting at the fixed point and stays there forever, and if some other trajectory 
      intersected this point it would contradict the uniqueness of solutions that we have. However, fixed points dominate the behavior
      of any system but especially 1D systems. In one dimension, each trajectory will either get arbitrarily close to a fixed point, or go off to infinity.
