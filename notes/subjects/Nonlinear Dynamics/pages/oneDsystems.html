      Now that we have shown that any higher order ODEs can be reduced into a system of first order ODEs, the ability to analyze
      first order ODEs is obviously important. The first step in this process is <strong>fixed point analysis</strong>.
    </p>

  <h2>Fixed Point Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned, we can analyze systems of autonomous first order ODEs individually at first. We begin with the aforementioned
      <strong>fixed point analysis.</strong>. First let's consider such a system,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          \dot{x} = f(x)
    \]</div>
    <p>The <strong>fixed points</strong>, are the points \(x^*\) such that</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          f(x^*) = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>Since the right hand side of these systems are algebraic, it is often pretty straightforward to find these points. 
      It's not always easy to find it analytically, but numerical approximations can work as well.
    </p>
    <p>Now what does it mean for our system when \(f(x) = 0\)? This means that our state variable \(x\) is not changing.
      That is, the derivative (instantaneous rate of change) is \(0\) and will stay \(0\). Since,
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
          \dot{x} = f(x^*) = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>Finding this point is simply finding the value of \(x\) at which the state will never move. This is why it's called a fixed point.
      Due to our uniqueness and existence theorems, we know that no other trajectory can ever intersect the fixed point. This is due
      to the fact that there is a trajectory starting at the fixed point and stays there forever, and if some other trajectory 
      intersected this point it would contradict the uniqueness of solutions that we have. However, fixed points dominate the behavior
      of any system but especially 1D systems. In one dimension, each trajectory will either get arbitrarily close to a fixed point, or go off to infinity.
      Now let's consider a concrete example.
    </p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Consider the 1D system called the <strong>Logistic Equation</strong> which models the population dynamics of a single
    species.
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \dot{x} = rx(1-\frac{x}{L})
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Where \(x(t)\) is the population of the species at time \(t\), \(r\) is the reproduction rate, and \(L\) is the carrying capacity. \(r\) and \(L\) are both constants. Now let's 
    find when the population stops changing. This happens when 
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    rx(1-\frac{x}{L}) = 0
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Rearranging for \(x\), we get</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    -\frac{x^2}{L} + x = 0
    \]
  </div>
  <p>This is a quadratic equation in \(x\), with \(a = -\frac{1}{L}, b = 1, c= 0\). The quadratic equation is.</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
    \]
  </div>
  <p>With our values we get</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
    \frac{(-1 \pm \sqrt{1})}{-2/L}
    \]
  </div>
  <p>\(L\) is a free parameter and so we will let \(L = 100\) for simplicity. Then we have two fixed points</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
    \begin{align}
    x_1 &= \frac{(-1 + 1)}{-2/100} = 0 \\\\
    x_2 &= \frac{(-1-1)}{-2/100} = 100
    \end{align}
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Now let's interpret this. If the population is originally at \(0\), then it will never grow. This makes sense
    and is physically accurate. On the other hand, if the population is at \(100\) (its carrying capacity), then it won't
    grow (or shrink), the population will remain at that value forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about other values? There are two important regions to consider, populations between \(0\) and \(100\) and 
    populations greater than \(100\). To understand them, we must understand the right hand side of the ODE, i.e.
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    rx(1-\frac{x}{100})
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Now let's take \(r=1.25\). In other words the population grows by a quarter of its current population. Choosing different values 
    of \(r\) will change the dynamics. We will discuss that later. Subbing \(1.25\) in, we have</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    1.25x(1-\frac{x}{100})
    \]
  </div>
  <p>This is a concave down parabola with zeros at \(x=0\) and \(x=100\) (as previously found).</p>
  <figure class="topic-figure">
  <img src="images/log.png" alt="logisticCurve" class="topic-img">
  <figcaption>\(1.25x(1-x^2)\) Graphed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This curve is itself what dictates the population change. So when this curve is negative, we have 
  population loss, conversely when it is positive, we have population growth. In 1D it is useful to plot 
  \(x\) vs. \(\dot{x}\). Where \(\dot{x}\) is given by the curve above. Doing so, we have the following graph.
</p>
  <figure class="topic-figure">
  <img src="images/lineFlow.png" alt="flow" class="topic-img">
  <figcaption>\(x\) vs. \(\dot{x}\) Graphed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The blue line represents the actual population. The arrows are vector arrows, it tells you where the population 
  will move in time. Notice the two circles at \(x=0\) and \(x=100\). As we can see for the one at \(x=0\), all
  arrows point away from it. We say that this fixed point is <strong>unstable</strong>, we also sometimes call 
  it a <strong>source</strong>. We denote this graphically with the empty circle as shown in the image.
  Now consider the fixed point at \(x=100\). All arrows near it are pointing towards it. We call this fixed point
  <strong>stable</strong> and in some contexts, <strong>attracting</strong>. These fixed points are denoted graphically
  with filled in circles as shown. Now we can deduce the fundamental nature of the entire system as follows: if 
  the population is above \(100\), the population will decline to \(100\) (technically will get arbitrarily close and 
  never touch it). If the population is greater than \(0\) but less than \(100\), then it will grow to 
  \(100\) (similarly arbitrarily close but not exactly \(100\)). If the populations start at either of the fixed 
  points \(0\) or \(100\), then they will remain there forever. The rate of growth at a certain population can be 
  deduced by taking the derivative of the right hand side with respect to \(x\) (not \(t\)). We can see this 
  graphically as well. The slope of the curve above is the speed at which the population is changing.
  This peaks near the beginning and decreases until around \(x=50\) (middle of the parabola) and then becomes negative, causing a decreased rate as it approaches 
  \(100\). More quantitatively, we can inspect how fast the population will change with respect to the current 
  population by taking the derivative of it with respect to \(x\). In our example, if 
</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    f(x) = 1.25x(1-\frac{x}{100})
    \]
  </div>
<p>Then, we can find the rate of change of this function by computing </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \frac{df}{dx} = r(1-\frac{2x}{L})
    \]
  </div>
  <p>This leads us to the final step in this level of analysis. Linearization.</p>

  <h2>Linearization and Fixed Point Stability</h2>
  <p>Although we can see all of this graphically, we need a way to mathematically deduce these results. This is 
    where <strong>linearization</strong> is used. The idea is that we want to see what would happen to a 
    trajectory that starts very close to a fixed point. Does it grow further away? Does it grow closer? Can we not tell?
    We can answer these with linearization. First, as mentioned, consider a small perturbation near a fixed point.
    First, let's consider a general first order autonomous ODE.
  </p>
        <div class="math-block">\[
    \dot{x} = f(x)
    \]
  </div>
    
    <p>Let,
  </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
    x = x^*+\eta(t)
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Where \(x^*\) is a fixed point and \(\eta\) is a small perturbation near the fixed point. Then, 
  </p>
      <div class="math-block">\[
    \dot{x} = \dot{\eta}(t)
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Since \(x^*\) is a fixed point, its derivative is \(0\). Furthermore, since</p>
    </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
  \dot{x} = f(x),
  \]</div>

  <p>
  we get
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
  \dot{\eta}(t) = f(x) = f(x^* + \eta(t)).
  \]</div>
  <p>Therefore, we have</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
  \dot{\eta}(t) = f(x^* + \eta(t)).
  \]</div>

  <p>
  Now we linearize using a Taylor expansion of \(f\) about \(x^*\):
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">\[
  f(x^* + \eta) \approx f(x^*) + f'(x^*)\eta + \mathcal{O}(\eta^2).
  \]</div>

  <p>
  But \(f(x^*) = 0\) since \(x^*\) is a fixed point. Ignoring higher-order terms gives
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">\[
  \dot{\eta}(t) \approx f'(x^*) \eta(t).
  \]</div>
  <p>Note that for the \(x-x^*\) term in the Taylor expansion, we get that </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
  x = x^* + \eta(t) \implies \eta(t) = x-x^*
  \]</div>
  <p>Now back to</p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
  \dot{\eta}(t) \approx f'(x^*) \eta(t).
  \]</div>

  <p>
  This is a linear differential equation whose solution is
  </p>

  <div class="math-block">\[
  \eta(t) = \eta(0) e^{f'(x^*) t}.
  \]</div>

  <p>
  Finally:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If \(f'(x^*) &lt; 0\), then \(\eta(t) \to 0\) and the fixed point is <b>stable</b>.</li>
    <li>If \(f'(x^*) &gt; 0\), then \(\eta(t)\) grows and the fixed point is <b>unstable</b>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  A <b>hyperbolic fixed point</b> is a fixed point where \(f'(x^*) \neq 0\).  
  If \(f'(x^*) = 0\), the point is called <b>non-hyperbolic</b>, and higher-order terms must be analyzed to determine stability.
  So as long as the point is hyperbolic, we can quantitatively determine its stability. Let's try it for our example 
  above.
  </p>
<h2>Linearization of the Logistic Equation</h2>
  <p>This is pretty straightforward; we already have the expression for the linearization, we just need 
    to compute the necessary derivatives for each fixed point. First let's pre-compute \(f'\), so that we have it
    for both expressions.
  </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      f(x) = 1.25x(1-\frac{x}{100})
  \]</div>
  <div class="math-block">\[
      \implies f'(x) = 1.25-2.5\frac{x}{100}
  \]</div>
  <p>Now let's consider \(x^* = 0\)</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
       f'(0) = 1.25 \implies f'(x^*) > 0
  \]</div>
  <p>Therefore, we have shown that the fixed point \(x^* = 0\) is <strong>unstable</strong> (aka repelling or a source).
  Any nearby trajectories grow in time. </p>
  <p>Finally, let's consider the fixed point \(x^* = 100\)</p>
      <div class="math-block">\[
        \begin{align}
       f'(100) &= 1.25-2.5 \cdot \frac{100}{100} \\
       f'(100) &= -1.25 \implies f'(x^*) < 0
       \end{align}
  \]</div>
  <p>Therefore we see that both fixed points are <strong>hyperbolic</strong>, and that the second 
  fixed point \(x^* = 100\) is <strong>stable</strong> (aka attracting or a sink). Any nearby trajectories are 
  pulled towards the fixed point, sort of like a blackhole.</p>
  <p>We have now gone over fixed point analysis and linearization for 1D systems. These concepts are extremely 
    important and typically the first steps to analyzing any system. In higher dimensions, we build upon these 
    ideas with things like the <strong>Jacobian</strong>. Again, the intuition behind linearization is to see 
    what would happen if we started a trajectory very close to a fixed point. If the distance to the fixed point decays, then it's 
    attracting. If the distance to the fixed point grows, then it's repelling. This concludes the preliminary 
    analysis of 1D systems. However, this is not all. I cover dependence on parameters in the next section 
    and how changing parameters can make or break stability. These qualitative changes in the system's 
    behavior are known as <strong>bifurcations</strong>, and they have very rich and interesting theory.
