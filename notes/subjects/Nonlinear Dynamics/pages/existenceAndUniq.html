    <p>
      The beauty of the geometry of dynamical systems is due to the existence and uniqueness theorems for ODEs. These results
      give us the conditions under which ODEs have solutions, and when those solutions are unique. Once we have these results,
      we can make some very powerful observations about any system described by them.
    </p>
  <h2>Preliminary Result</h2>
  <p>Before we get into the theorems, we must know the solution to first order linear ODEs with constant coefficients.
    These are ODEs of the form
  </p>
  <div class="math-block">\[
    \dot{x} = rx
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Such systems always have solutions of the form</p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
        x(t) = Ae^{rt}
    \]
  </div>
  <p>Where \(A\) is determined by \(x(0)\).</p>
