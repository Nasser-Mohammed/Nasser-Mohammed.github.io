      As we have seen in the preliminary analysis of 1D systems, there aren't many possibilities for their 
      behavior. Trajectories either decay to fixed points or go off to infinity. However, there are some very 
      important considerations regarding a system's dependence on parameters. Often, in real models, we cannot
       determine parameters with infinite precision, and sometimes the parameters can change for a multitude 
       of reasons. Therefore, we must understand the connection between a system's behavior and its parameters. 
       This is the study of <strong>bifurcations</strong>: qualitative changes in a system's dynamics due to a 
       change in a parameter.
