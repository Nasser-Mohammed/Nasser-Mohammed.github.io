    <p>
      As we have seen in the preliminary analysis of 1D systems, there aren't many possibilities for their 
      behavior. Trajectories either decay to fixed points or go off to infinity. However, there are some very 
      important considerations regarding a system's dependence on parameters. Often, in real models, we cannot
      determine parameters with infinite precision, and sometimes the parameters can change for a multitude 
      of reasons. Therefore, we must understand the connection between a system's behavior and its parameters. 
      This is the study of <strong>bifurcations</strong>: qualitative changes in a system's dynamics due 
      to a change in the system's parameter(s).
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Bifurcation?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>bifurcation</strong> occurs when a small smooth change in a parameter of a system causes a sudden 
      qualitative change in its behavior. More concretely, consider the parameterized system
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      \dot{x} = f(x,\mu),
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
      where \(\mu\) is a parameter. A bifurcation happens at a value \(\mu = \mu_c\) if the phase portrait of the system 
      for \(\mu < \mu_c\) is not topologically equivalent to that for \(\mu > \mu_c\). In practice, this often means 
      that fixed points appear, disappear, or change stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Bifurcations in the Logistic Equation</h2>
    <p>
      A classical example is the <strong>logistic equation</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      \dot{x} = rx(1 - x),
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
      where the parameter \(r\) represents the growth rate. The fixed points of this system are obtained by setting 
      \(\dot{x} = 0\):
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      x^* = 0, \quad x^* = 1.
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
      The stability of each fixed point depends on the parameter \(r\). We compute
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      f'(x) = r(1 - 2x).
    \]
    </div>
    <p>
      At \(x^* = 0\), we have \(f'(0) = r\). Thus the fixed point is stable if \(r < 0\) and unstable if \(r > 0\).
      At \(x^* = 1\), we have \(f'(1) = -r\). So the fixed point is stable if \(r > 0\).
    </p>
    <p>
      At \(r = 0\), the stability of the fixed points changes: the fixed point at \(x=0\) changes from stable to unstable,
      while the fixed point at \(x=1\) emerges as stable. This is an example of a <strong>transcritical bifurcation</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Bifurcations</h2>
    <p>
      In one-dimensional systems, the most common local bifurcations are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saddle-node bifurcation</strong>: two fixed points collide and annihilate each other.</li>
      <li><strong>Transcritical bifurcation</strong>: two fixed points exchange stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Pitchfork bifurcation</strong>: one fixed point splits into three (supercritical or subcritical).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each type of bifurcation has a characteristic "normal form" equation, which captures its essential behavior.
