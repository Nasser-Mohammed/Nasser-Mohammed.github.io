    <p>
      We start with a non-empty set \(V\) of elements. A <em>vector space over a field</em> \(K\) is a set equipped with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying the usual axioms.
      In practice, a quick test for many common examples is to check that \(V\) is closed under (i) addition and (ii) scalar multiplication by elements of \(K\).
    </p>

    <div class="archive-box">
      <strong>Terminology.</strong> A set is <em>closed</em> under an operation if performing the operation on elements of the set produces an element still in the set.
      Saying \(V\) is “over” a field \(K\) means scalar multiplication \(K\times V\to V\) is defined. Typical fields are the reals \(\mathbb{R}\) and complexes \(\mathbb{C}\).
    </div>

    <p>
      Elements of a vector space are called <em>vectors</em>. Vector spaces arise from numbers, functions, sequences, polynomials, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Subspaces</h2>
    <p>
      A <em>subspace</em> of a vector space is a subset that is itself a vector space (using the same operations). In short, it is a vector space contained in another vector space.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Span</h2>
    <p>
      Let \(T=\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_m\}\). The <em>span</em> of \(T\) is the set of all finite linear combinations of vectors from \(T\):
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      \operatorname{span}(T)=\Big\{\, \sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i v_i : c_i\in K\,\Big\}.
    \]</div>
    <p>
      The span of any set of vectors is a subspace. If one vector in \(T\) is a linear combination of the others (e.g., \(v_3=v_1+v_2\)), then removing it does not change the span.
      Thus, sometimes more vectors do not enlarge the span.
    </p>

    <h2>Linear Independence</h2>
    <p>
      A set \(T=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}\) is <em>linearly independent</em> if the only solution to
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0
    \]</div>
    <p>
      is the trivial one, \(c_1=\cdots=c_n=0\). Otherwise it is <em>linearly dependent</em>.
      Equivalently, if there exist coefficients, not all zero, with the sum equal to \(0\), then some vector (say \(v_1\)) can be written as a linear combination of the others:
    </p>
    <div class="math-block">\[
      v_1 = -\frac{c_2}{c_1}v_2 - \cdots - \frac{c_n}{c_1}v_n \quad (c_1\neq 0).
    \]</div>
    <p>
      Such a vector is redundant for spanning, so the span is unchanged by removing it.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Minimal Spanning Set</h2>
    <p>
      A <em>minimal spanning set</em> of a vector space is a smallest set of vectors whose span equals the whole space. Equivalently, it is a spanning set that is linearly independent.
    </p>

    <h2>Basis of Vector Spaces</h2>
    <p>
      A <em>basis</em> of a vector space is a linearly independent set that spans the space. In finite dimensions, every vector can be written uniquely as a
      finite linear combination of basis vectors, and the number of basis elements is the <em>dimension</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In infinite-dimensional spaces, linear combinations may require convergence notions (topology). These are addressed in notes on topological vector spaces.
