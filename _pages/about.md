I am currently a master's student in mathematics at LSU. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Mathematics at LSU as well. I plan on using this page to post things like personal notes on topics, expositions, and tips.

Research Interests
======
My current interests lie in differential equations (ordinary and partial), numerical analysis, and probability theory.
