I am currently a master's student in mathematics at LSU. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Mathematics at LSU as well. I plan on using this page to post things like personal notes on topics, expositions, and solutions to selected problems.

Research Interests
======
My general interests lie in differential equations (ordinary and partial), numerical analysis, and probability theory. More specifically, I am interested in dynamical systems and control theory, and their applications.
