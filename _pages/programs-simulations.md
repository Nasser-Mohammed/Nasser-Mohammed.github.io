Below are links to some programs and simulations I have built. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the web design and JavaScript exclusively for the computation. I originally planned on using Python and converting it to WebAssembly, as I was opposed to learning JavaScript. I ended up just learning JavaScript and it turned out to be quite a fun language to use.
