\\[i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x, t)\\]
The (time dependent) Schrödinger equation describes a function \\(Psi(x,t)\\), which encodes all of the physical information about the quantum state of a quantum particle (in our case this will be the Hydrogen atom). As mentioned, we will discuss the Schrödinger Equation for the Hydrogen atom. To be continued.
