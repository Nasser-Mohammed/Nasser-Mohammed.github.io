\\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u + ru(1-\frac{u}{K})\\]
The Fisher-KPP equation is a very intuitive reaction diffusion equation, as it combines the concept of diffusion and logistic growth (the reaction term in this case). We can visualize this equation relatively easily. Think of an empty grid (2D plane), now we drop a concrentation of something (representing \\(u\)). Now, we know this
