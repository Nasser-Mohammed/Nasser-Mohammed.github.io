\\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u + ru(1-\frac{u}{K})\\]
The Fisher-KPP equation is a very intuitive reaction diffusion equation, as it combines the concept of diffusion and logistic growth (the reaction term in this case). We can visualize this equation relatively easily. Think of an empty grid (2D plane), then imagine that we drop a concrentation of something (representing \\(u\\)), this could be a type of liquid, a concentration of some species, etc. Now, the concentration will begin spreading out across the 2D plane. Simultaneously, where there concentration has already diffused, the logistic term will start kicking in. That is, once the concentration has diffused through a part of the plane, that concentration will also begin growing (due to the logistic term). Again, we can think of this as a population spreading and multiplying. The thing to note, is that the population cannot grow at a point until the diffusion reaches that point. This is intuitive, but it's captured by the logistic term: \\(ru(1-\frac{u}{K})\\). Since the value of \\(u\\) will be \\(0\\) where the diffusion hasn't reached, the logistic term will remain \\(0\\). Now back to the diffusion, once a part of the plane gets some diffusion, the logistic term will kick in as mentioned. This means that the concentration at that point will begin to grow (exponentially) to its carrying capacity \\(K\\) where it will level off. However, the growth isn't just limited to the logistic term. The diffusion process also carries populations from higher concentrations to lower ones. This represents the concept that the population will not sit in one place and grow, but instead grow and diffuse according to the available "space". The rate of diffusion \\(\alpha\\) and the rate of growth \\(r\\) of the species determines the more qualitative nature of the growth and diffusion. That is, it determines the dynamics of the "simulation". A very slow diffusion and high rate of growth will allow populations to explode to their carrying capacity without the diffusion process draining the population. In other words, the diffusion process acts as a sort of instruction of how fast the population is required to spread out. So if this rate is low, a population will not be negatively affected by their own population wanting to spread throughout the space. On the other hand, a high diffusion rate and low rate of growth will prevent the population from getting large until the population has completely spread throughout the closed plane we are considering. Once the diffusion has sort of reached an equilibrium, the logistic growth will then occur and the rates everywhere would be relatively similar. Below is an example of a simulation of the equation I ran with python:
