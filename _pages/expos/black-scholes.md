<hr style="border: 2px solid black;">
\\[\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} = rV - rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\\]
Rewriting it in a more concise format yields:
\\[V_t + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2V_{SS} = rV - rSV_S\\]
Nonetheless, both equations are the same. This PDE is used to determine the fair price of a financial asset. To be continued.
