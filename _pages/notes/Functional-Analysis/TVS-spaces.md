There are several different characterizations of topological vector spaces (TVS) with various levels of importance (in a general sense). I will describe the most notable ones, and their relation to other TVS. \\

## Topological Vector Spaces 
We begin with first defining what a topological vector space is, which will set the outline for the most general form these spaces can take. A vector space \\(E\\) over \\(\mathbb{C}\\) becomes a topological vector space when it is equipped with a topology that is compatible with
the linear structure of \\(E\\). A topology being compatible with the linear structure of a vector space means that vector addition and scalar multiplication are both continuous mappings. That is
\\[A_v: E \times E \to E, \ \ \ (x,y) \to x+y\\]
\\[M_s: \mathbb{C}\times E \to E \ \ \ (\lambda, x) \to \lambda x\\]
Are both continuous mappings.
