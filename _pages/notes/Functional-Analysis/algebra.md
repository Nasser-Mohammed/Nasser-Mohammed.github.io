Since the theory of Functional Analysis is a reconciliation of topological and vector space characteristics and compatibility, we
naturally necessitate some level of "algebraic" theory. The intent of this page is to go over some of the algebraic concepts to 
allow for an ease of understanding when going through the other content.

## Algebraic Dual Space

## Natural Injection
Consider,
$$f:E \to F$$\\
Then the natural injection is the injective map \\(i\\), such that
$$i: im(E) \to F$$\\
In other words, since \\(f\\) might not take every element of \\(E\\) to \\(F\\), we then define the natural injection from that image to the full set \\(F\\). This allows us to embed the algebraic structure of a smaller set into a larger set.

## Natural Projection
