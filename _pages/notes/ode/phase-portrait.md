If we denote the position of some object by the function \\(x(t)\\), then by definition, the velocity of that object is defined by the derivative of its displacement (which is the position) and therefore the velocity is simply \\(\dot{x}\\). As I go through various ODEs, you should keep this relationship in the back of your head. Now, let's consider the most basic ODE:
\\[\dot{x} = Cx\\]
Where \\(C\\) is just some constant.
