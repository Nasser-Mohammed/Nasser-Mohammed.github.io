One of the simplest 2nd order ODEs that we can solve explicitly, is the so called **damped harmonic oscillator**. We will begin with the derivation of this ODE with some basic Newtonian mechanics. First, imagine that there is a small object attached to the end of a spring. This spring, when pulled, exerts a restoring force of \\(-k\\) on the object. In other words, it applies a force to bring the object back towards itself. See the video below for more intuition.
