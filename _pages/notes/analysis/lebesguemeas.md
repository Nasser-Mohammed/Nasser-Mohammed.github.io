The Lebesgue Measure was introduced to generalize our intuition of *sizes*, to subsets of \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\) (Euclidean Space). Our intuition of sizes naturally comes from the known sizes of the basic geometric shapes, such as, circles, rectangles, cubes, etc. With this in mind, we try to "cover" these subsets of \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\) with these shapes, and calculate the *size* of the sets with the shapes that cover it.
