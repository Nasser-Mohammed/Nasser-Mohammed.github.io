The Poisson kernel is frequently used and studied in the context of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. I will not go over its importance in those fields. Instead I will introduce its derivation, and why we'd even expect to see such a function.

## Derivation
The equivalence below is a well known result for infinite series of this form
\\[\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}r^k = \frac{1}{1-r} \ \ \ \text{ where } |r| < 1\\]
