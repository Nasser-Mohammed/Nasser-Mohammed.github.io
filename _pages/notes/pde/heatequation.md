\\[u_t=\alpha^2u_{xx}\\]

Solved by Joseph Fourier in 1822, the heat equation is typically the first PDE students are introduced to, due to its nice and intuitive nature.
In one dimension, we seek a function, that essentially has its first time derivative equal to its second space derivative (for preliminary intuition, we can ignore the \\(\alpha^2\\) term). The question now, is how do we go about solving for the function or functions that satisfy this equation. Intuitively this should feel like a more daunting task than solving for a variable in a traditional algebraic equation. This intuition is correct, without additional information, this equation has an infinite number of solutions. For example, any constant value satisfies this equation, any linear polynomial in \\(x\\) with arbitrary coefficients will satisfy this equation, as well as many other equations. This leads us to our typical boundary conditions.
