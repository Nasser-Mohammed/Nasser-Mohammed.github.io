We consider the standard 1-D heat equation with an inhomogeneity of \\(f(x,t)\\). The idea, is to write this inhomgeneity \\(f(x,t)\\) as a sin-series, as well as rewriting \\(u(x,t)\\) as a sin-series. Once we rewrite the PDE in this way, we can make some observations that allow us to solve the problem.
